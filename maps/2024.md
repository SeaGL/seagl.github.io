### Parking

There are several on-campus parking options located near the HUB. We recommend
the [Padelford Parking Garage] if there is space. Otherwise, the [E18 lot] is
more affordable and available. Street parking off-campus can be hard to come by
and is usually time-constrained.

### Accommodations

If you are looking for a place to stay, we recommend the [University Inn] as an
affordable option. The University Inn is located at 4140 Roosevelt Way NE and is
approximately a 16 minute walk from the venue. For public transit, bus 65 has a
stop near the University Inn and that route can take you to the west edge of the
UW campus. Otherwise, it's about a 6 minute drive.
