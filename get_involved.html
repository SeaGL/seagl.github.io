        <h2>Volunteer for SeaGL</h2>
        <p>
			SeaGL organization for 2021 has kicked off!
			Would you like to help with a great hybrid (or virtual only pandemic depending) conference based out of the US Pacific Northwest?
			Our 8th conference last year was also our first virtual conference and we had volunteers from 4 continents.
			This year we hope to have both physical location and a strong online component for a hybrid conference.
			With returning to a physical location we will especially need local volunteers from the Pacific Northwest.

			If you'd like to help please email us at {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }} and we'll send you an invitation to join our organizing meetings every other Monday at 17:00 Pacific Time (UTC-7).

        </p>
        <h2>Sponsors and Non-Profit Exhibitors</h2>

            We will have a virtual hall available for exhibitors for the 2020 virtual conference experience.
            There are several sponsorship levels for commercial enterprises,
            and free rooms available for local non-profit or educational
            organizations. Please see our <a href="/sponsors/{{ site.custom.year }}.html">sponsors page</a>
