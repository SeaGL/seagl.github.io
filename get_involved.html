        <h2>Volunteer for SeaGL</h2>
        <p>
			SeaGL organization for 2021 has kicked off!
			Would you like to help with a great virtual only (per pandemic) conference based out of the US Pacific Northwest?
			Our 8th conference last year was also our first virtual conference and we had volunteers from 4 continents.
			This year we are returning to a fully virtual model and need volunteers to make it happen.

			If you'd like to help please email us at {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }} and we'll send you an invitation to join our organizing meetings every other Monday at 17:00 Pacific Time (UTC-7).

        </p>
        <h2>Sponsors and Non-Profit Exhibitors</h2>
        <p>
            Once again, we will have a virtual exhibitor hall for both community and corporate sponsors of SeaGL 2021.
            Groups and companies interested in attending should take a look at our <a href="{{ site.custom.url.prospectus }}">Exhibitor/Sponsor Prospectus</a>
            which outlines various tiers and add-ons available. We do accept in-kind contributions from local and media
            partners, and free space is available for non-profit and educational organizations. Please see our
            <a href="/sponsors/{{ site.custom.year }}.html">sponsors page</a> for a list of current supporters and email
            us at {{ site.custom.a.email.sponsor }} to discuss further partnership opportunities!
