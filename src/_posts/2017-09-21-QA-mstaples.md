Margaret Staples gives her talk titled, "Philosophy in Code: I Kant Even" on [Saturday morning](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2017/program/proposals/321).

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?
 
A: I'm a cyborg but with really primitive upgrades.  You'll see me rolling around and sometimes maybe laying down to give my bionicness some recharge time.  I've been into computers since before they were common enough for me to have touched one, but my formal education is in World History.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?
 
A: You can expect me to be ridiculously enthusiastic about logic and programming.
 
Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?
 
A: Yes! I'm doing my best not to form any expectations, but I did meet someone from the org at PNWPHP last week and they were super nice, so I am hoping most people there will also be super nice :)

Q: Do you have a dog you would like to tell us about? 

A: Why yes I do! Her name is Lilith. She's a black lab border collie mix made entirely of sweetness and joy.  She's been with me for 16 years so you could say she's my old lady. She's a very good girl.
