Omar Ravenhurst gives his talk titled, "From Al-Qaeda to Shia LaBeouf - How Crowdsourced Intelligence Analysis Removed Any Idea Of Privacy: Finding What Doesn't Want To Be Found" on [Friday afternoon.](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2017/program/proposals/339)

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?

A: I'm Omar Ravenhurst. I'm a Linux and privacy enthusiast. I do cool things sometimes. I've worked in the "tech industry" for a bit but right now I'm teaching myself various things.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?

A: Mostly what it says on the tin. Education and speculation. Some tips, and hopefully a few jokes.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

A: First time at SeaGL. I'm expecting something like Linuxfest Northwest but smaller. People, talks, vendors, and parties. Also bad wifi.*

Q:  If you cut a sandwich in half, do you have two halves of a sandwich or two sandwiches? 

A: The answer is two sandwiches and if you say differently then you're just factually wrong. Open a dictionary.


<i>* Editor's note: the wifi was fine last year except in that one room -- which we're keeping a surprise for new attendees.</i>
