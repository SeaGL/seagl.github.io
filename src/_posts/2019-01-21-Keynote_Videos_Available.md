And, as an extra bonus, we even have [a video](https://archive.org/details/seagl2018-cascadia-community-builder-award) of the presentation of the [2018 Cascadia Community Builder Award](https://seagl.org/news/2018/11/13/CCBA_Winner.html) to Don Sheu.

Thank you, everyone, for making SeaGL 2018 amazing. We'll be starting work soon on SeaGL 2019. If you're interested in helping with SeaGL 2019, we'd love for you to [join us](https://seagl.org/get_involved.html).
