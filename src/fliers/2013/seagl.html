    <p class="lead">SeaGL is Seattle's newest grassroots technical conference.
    We are dedicated to spreading awareness and knowledge about the GNU/Linux
    ecosystem, Free Software, and the Open Source movement.</p>

    <p class="lead">Our goal for SeaGL is to produce an event which is both
    enjoyable and informative for all ranges of skill and experience.  We're
    starting small this year but have managed to pull together a great lineup
    of volunteer presenters, and we hope that you have a great time while
    you're here.</p>
    
    <h2><strong>The cost of attendance is free.</strong></h2>
