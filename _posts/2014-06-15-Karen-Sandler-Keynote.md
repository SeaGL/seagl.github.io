We are super-excited to welcome Karen Sandler to Seattle this year to keynote
the second Seattle GNU/Linux Conference. Ms. Sandler is a long-time free
software advocate, both as a lawyer and a leader. She has worked with the
[Software Freedom Law Center](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/) where she helped
many, many free software projects with legal concerns -- from incorporation to
GPL questions. Until recently, she was the executive director at the
[GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/) where she expanded the
[Outreach Program for Women](https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen)
which won the Free Software Foundation's
[Award for Projects of Social Benefit](https://www.fsf.org/news/free-software-award-winners-announced)
this year . She is now leading the Software Freedom Conservancy as Executive
Director as they work to expand the administrative and strategic support they
provide for free software projects. She also serves an advisor to the Ada
Initiative and as pro bono General Counsel to
[QuestionCopyright.Org](https://questioncopyright.org/).
