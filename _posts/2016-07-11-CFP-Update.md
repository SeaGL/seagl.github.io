So... how is the CFP going?

Considering submitting a proposal or two to the SeaGL CFP, but perhaps you aren't certain what kinds of talks we could really use? Well, that's the point of this post, to give you a sense of what we feel we could use more of in our CFP responses.

* We are a local Seattle conference dedicated to supporting newer local speakers. In the Pacific Northwest and want to get started with conference speaking? We'd love to hear from you.
* Currently only around 20% of our proposals are from women, we would very much like to see more proposals from women.
* Intro topics are pretty sparse. SeaGL is attended by lots of students and younger folks who love intro topics.
* Web frameworks and web tools; got Joomla, Drupal, Wordpress, or other web dev know-how? We'd love to see a talk from you!
* Tips and tricks from folks who live in language land; tell us how you're currently using Python, Perl, Java, Rust, Javascript, Ruby, etc.
* We also have lots of experienced free software users who attend SeaGL and want to hear what's happening with BSD or GNU as well as nerd out on the latest automation tweaks.
* Privacy and policy topics are welcome and unifying topics at SeaGL. Please share your tips & tricks (or concerns & fears) about vulnerabilities, proposed legislation, terrible court cases, etc.


[Submit your presentation](https://osem.seagl.org/conference/seagl2016/program/proposal/new) now.

**The CFP deadline is midnight PDT, August 1, 2016.**

If you'd like CFP support, join our team for one of our [CFP office hours](https://seagl.org/news/2016/06/24/Office-Hours.html). They want to help you come up with talk ideas and polish your proposals.

Our talk format is generally 50 minutes of speaking followed by 10 minutes of questions, so an hour total.

Right now, since we're a relatively new community organized and non-profit event, we're unable to provide travel funding for speakers.
