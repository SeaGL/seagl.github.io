This year we're pleased to introduce TeaGL, the SeaGL Tea Swap!

If there's any tea you particularly enjoy, bring it along to SeaGL on Saturday and bring enough for a few other people. Share your tea with the SeaGL community and try some interesting teas brought by others.

Black, green, white, herbal, whatever! All teas are welcome at TeaGL.

The sharing happens all day, so bring your tea to the expo hall in the morning on Saturday. We've also dedicated the Saturday afternoon break as Tea Time so all tea lovers (or simply tea curious) can get together in the expo hall, visit with our sponsors, and have a nice cuppa.
