Our goal is for SeaGL to be a welcoming place for first time (and veteran) speakers. We are therefore pleased to announce the launch of SeaGL 2022 [CFP](https://seagl.org/news/2022/07/06/CFP-Live.html) Office Hours! Office Hours are designed to provide an opportunity for prospective speakers to receive real time assistance with their talks and/or CFP submissions.

Are you unsure which of your two talk ideas to submit (hint: submit both!)? Do you need help crafting an abstract for your talk? Or perhaps you are interested in guidance on how to adapt an existing talk you have presented for a SeaGL audience. We will have members of the SeaGL Program Committee on hand to help answer these and any other questions you might have.

Office Hours will be taking place via chat on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#office-hours:seagl.org) (#office-hours:seagl.org) and [IRC](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#seagl-office-hours) (#seagl-office-hours on Libera.Chat) or on [video](https://meet.seattlematrix.org/SeaGL_Office_Hours) at the following times (Times are in PDT / UTC-7):
  * Mondays from 8:00am-9:00am
  * Wednesdays from 3:00pm-4:00pm
  * Fridays from 4:00pm-5:00pm
  * Saturdays from 1:00am-2:00am

If none of the office hours time slots fit your schedule or if you prefer to interact asynchronously, you can email your questions to [cfp-help@seagl.org](mailto:cfp-help@seagl.org) at any time.
