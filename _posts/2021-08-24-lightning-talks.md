We’re incredibly excited to announce that we’re hosting lightning talks at SeaGL this year!
Think of this space as a great opportunity to learn about fun topics, or even present your own talk.
It's a great way to get comfortable with speaking to an audience or to explore the kernel of an idea that could become a full-length talk at SeaGL 2022!

The lightning talks will be a series of 5 minute talks which will be pre-recorded - meaning
that we can accommodate speakers from all over the world!
We’re looking for any community focused talks.
A few examples are:

* Tech examples: Event organization, coding, design, documentation, open source, etc. 
* Non-tech examples: non-profit work, hobbies/programs (eg. community gardens), sports teams, theater, etc.

Our one request is that there are no promotions of any kind - meaning, please no video resumes, no company/product promos, etc. 

We’re looking forward to hearing from you, our community. Please [submit your talk ideas](https://forms.gle/3iVpzavUxmjLTXmm8) as soon as possible,
as we will be reviewing them on a rolling basis.
