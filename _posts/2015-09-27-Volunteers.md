We're looking for volunteers to help out on the days of the conference. We need helpers to assist speakers setting up in the presentation rooms, direct attendees towards rooms, and to complete other tasks.

If you're interested in volunteering, please contact us <a href="mailto:participate@seagl.org">here</a>.
