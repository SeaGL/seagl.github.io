One of the ways SeaGL supports first-time speakers is by holding CfP office hours.
If you have questions about the [Call for Proposals](/news/2021/06/24/cfp) process or want feedback on your talk proposal, you can join us in chat at [seagl.org/meet](/meet) or [on video](https://meet.seattlematrix.org/SeaGLCFPHelp) on:

* Sun Aug 1, 3pm PDT
* Tues Aug 3, 5:30pm PDT
* Sat Aug 7, 3pm PDT

We'd love to see you, whether you're making your first conference proposal or you're an experienced speaker!
Whether you need topic ideas or want help wrangling the central argument of your talk, we're here to help.
We'll also have some prepared topics for each session.

If you can't make the office hours, email your questions to [cfp-help@seagl.org](mailto:cfp-help@seagl.org) any time.

And many of us are on the channel much of the time besides, so come say hi!
We're in #SeaGL on [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) and [#SeaGL:seattlematrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#SeaGL:seattlematrix.org) on Matrix.
The rooms are bridged, so join us on the network and client of your choice.
If you haven't used IRC before, no sweat.
Join in [the browser chat version of the channel](/meet), choose a nickname, and you'll be in!
