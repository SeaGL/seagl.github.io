There's a lot that goes into crafting a great conference experience, and an essential part of that is sponsorship. Sponsorship helps cover a lot of necessities, like venue and equipment costs -  but it also allows the conference committee to do some truly extraordinary things for those who may not be able to attend without a helping hand. Without sponsorship, we would be unable to fund assistance like;
	
 - Help with the travel costs for less privileged speakers and attendees
 - Providing lunch to local student attendees 
 - Making SeaGL a free conference for all attendees

If you or your company are interested in sponsoring SeaGL, please contact us at {{ site.custom.a.email.sponsor }} to discuss the sponsorship packages available or check out our prospectus <a href="https://seagl.org/sponsors/SeaGL_Exhibitor_Sponsor_Prospectus_2016.pdf">here.</a>
