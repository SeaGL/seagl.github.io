**Nominations are open for the 2018 Cascadia Community Builder Award**

The Cascadia Community Builder Award is designed to recognize work in software projects, non-profit organizations, outreach and education, hackerspace, user groups or any activity that promotes the adoption and appreciation of free software to new and larger groups of people. The awards committee is especially interested in individuals who have successfully reached out to traditionally under-represented groups, even if that isn't their primary goal. 

To nominate someone, please send us an email email us at [award@seagl.org](mailto:award@seagl.org) with the nominee's name in the subject line. 

* Name and email address of the nominee (if you have it)
* A sentence or two about why you think they deserve this award
* Projects or organizations they serve through (links are very helpful!)

Please only nominate people who are doing their free software work in the [Cascadia region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_(bioregion)) and who are currently living. Thanks in advance for helping us honor a great community builder!

The award will be presented in November at SeaGL. Want to be part of the action? We're actively seeking volunteers! Just email [participate@seagl.org](mailto:participate@seagl.org) and introduce yourself!
