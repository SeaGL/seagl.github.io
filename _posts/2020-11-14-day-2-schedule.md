Today is our second and FINAL day of SeaGL 2020!  Here is the full [SeaGL 2020 program](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2020/schedule), and please read on for today's schedule, for Friday, November 13, 2020.  As a reminder, SeaGL 2020 is completely [virtual](https://seagl.org/news/2020/05/05/virtualconf-2020.html).  SeaGL is also completely free as in tea with no registration required, so everyone is welcome to attend.

You can attend if you go to [attend.seagl.org](https://attend.seagl.org).  Live streams are also available at [seagl.org/watch](https://seagl.org/watch).

Normal talk blocks are 30m - 20m for the talk, 10m for optional Q&A as led by the Room Moderator.  The Moderator will read questions from the text chat audience for the speaker to answer.  There are 15 minute spaces between talks, which means that the talk blocks are listed as 45 minutes long.  There is no Q&A during Keynotes.

Please note that as of 6:30pm PST Friday Nov 13, a few of these have changed.  Last minute schedule changes - it's a wild world out there this year, but we can accommodate :)
