Our next keynote announcement for 2018 is Elizabeth K. Joseph!

focuses on the Apache Mesos and DC/OS communities. Previously, she
spent four years as a systems engineer on the OpenStack Infrastructure
team and six years on the Ubuntu Community Council. She is the author
of Common OpenStack Deployments and The Official Ubuntu Book, 8th and
9th Editions. At home in the San Francisco bay area, she sits on the

Two keynote announcements down, two to go. Keep an eye out tomorrow for our next 2018 keynoter reveal!
