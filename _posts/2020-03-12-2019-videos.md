Following up our previous [announcement](https://seagl.org/news/2020/03/06/Last-Yrs-Keynotes-And-Dates.html) that the videos from our 2019 Keynote Presentations are available, we are pleased to share the videos for all remaining recorded talks.

Please be aware that unfortunately, due to an unknown issue, some of our recordings did not turn out. If we happen to find or receive a video file for any of the missing talks, we will be sure to update this post. We will also use this as a learning opportunity as we strive to improve heading into SeaGL 2020.
