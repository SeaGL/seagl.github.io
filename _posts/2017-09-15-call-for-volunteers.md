**Volunteer with SeaGL this Year!** 

We'd love to have you! SeaGL is an all-volunteer conference, which means it's very easy to become part of the action.

We're looking for folks to sign up to be room monitors. Maybe you'll meet your idol? Duties include: 

* Introduce the speaker 
* Be on hand in case they need anything
* Possibly help with the mic or the projector
* Make sure your session finishes on time

We're also looking for general day-of volunteers. Full of (hopefully) mild surprises and you'll meet some nice people. Duties include:

* Greet people at the registration desk
* Help with signage before the event
* Help with tidying up at the end of each day
* Carrying cables or fruit from one place to another

We also have some easy opportunities to help promote SeaGL; bringing flyers to a meet-up, coffee shop or another local nerdy event. 

Interested? Just email us! {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }} 
or visit us on IRC at
[Freenode]({{ site.custom.url.irc.network }}) in
[#seagl]({{ site.custom.url.irc.webchat }}).
