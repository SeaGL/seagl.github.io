SeaGL tea-lovers rejoice, we are bringing back the TeaGL tea swap this year! [Sign-ups](https://cloud.seagl.org/index.php/apps/forms/s/bqYcZqQCYB7b5pH3RPeX6ZGk) are now open and will close on **Friday, October 31st**. The swap itself will take place during the afternoon TeaGL break on Saturday, just as people’s adrenaline is wearing thin from two straight days of talks and FLOSS fun. However, we welcome everyone to gather during the TeaGL break both days to enjoy a nice hot cuppa.

If you would like to participate in the tea swap, fill out [this form](https://cloud.seagl.org/index.php/apps/forms/s/bqYcZqQCYB7b5pH3RPeX6ZGk) and we will contact you before the event with details about your TeaGL buddy’s preferences. If you would prefer *anonymi-tea*, you can choose to keep your name private from your trade buddy.

We’re so excited to share this SeaGL tradition and all the keeping calm it entails!
