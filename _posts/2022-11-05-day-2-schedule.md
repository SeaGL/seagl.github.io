Below, you will find the schedule for today (Saturday, November 5, 2022). As a reminder, SeaGL 2022 is completely [virtual](/news/2022/06/28/Virtual_SeaGL_2022.html) for the third year in a row. The conference is also completely "free as in tea" with no registration required. Everyone is welcome to attend!

You can attend if you go to [seagl.org/attend](/attend). Live streams are also available at [seagl.org/watch](/watch).

As a reminder, our [Code of Conduct](/code_of_conduct.html) applies during ALL SeaGL interactions. In chat, during one's talk if you are giving one, social events during SeaGL, and on other platforms during or as a result of the conference.

Normal talk blocks are 30m. There are 20m for the talk, and 10m for optional Q&A as led by the Room Moderator. The Moderator will read questions from the text chat audience for the speaker to answer. There is no Q&A during Keynotes.
