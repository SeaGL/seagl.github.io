Did you perhaps forget to submit your [talk proposal](https://seagl.org/news/2022/07/06/CFP-Live.html) before the deadline?
Wish you had a little extra time to put the finishing touch on your abstract or to submit a second (or third) propsoal?
In that case, we've got good news for you. We have decided to extend the CFP deadline two weeks until Friday, August 19.
We will also be continuing to hold [CFP Office Hours](https://seagl.org/news/2022/07/22/office-hours.html) during this extension.
So be sure to take advantage of this extension and not delay, get your talk proposals in today!
