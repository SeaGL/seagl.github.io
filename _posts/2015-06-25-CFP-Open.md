It doesn't matter if this is your first conference presentation or your

and open source software, then we want to hear about it! Below are some sample
subjects that will appeal to our audience:

* How to get involved in free and open source software
* Dev/Ops: both beginner and advanced topics
* Career tips and strategies
* Web development tools
* Policy and licensing that affects free and open source software development
* Hardware, Embedded Linux, or the Internet of Things
* Scaling and optimizing GNU/Linux
* The "cloud" and other distributed services
* Building free and open source communities
* Using free software at home, work, or school
* Security and privacy online
* Anything else that you think would be interesting to new or seasoned GNU/Linux enthusiasts!

**The CFP deadline is midnight on July 26th (PDT).** We look forward to seeing
your presentations!
