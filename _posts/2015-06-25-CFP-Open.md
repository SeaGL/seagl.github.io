* Dev/Ops: both beginner and advanced topics
* Career tips and strategies
* Web development tools
* Policy and licensing that affects free and open source software development
* Hardware, Embedded Linux, or the Internet of Things
* Scaling and optimizing GNU/Linux
* The "cloud" and other distributed services
* Building free and open source communities
* Using free software at home, work, or school
* Security and privacy online
* Anything else that you think would be interesting to new or seasoned GNU/Linux enthusiasts!

**The CFP deadline is midnight on July 26th (PDT).** We look forward to seeing
your presentations!
