We need YOU!  To help us select keynoters for SeaGL 2020!  Please use our form to [nominate a keynote speaker](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpDCLYLXC4OecykkvhotT1XboOFOZ22X-OyM4go6EzLW95gg/viewform).  We are looking for open source community members with experiences and stories to share.  We are, as always, looking for new candidates who have not keynoted before, who have a different perspective to share.  Our community is vast, therefore our keynotes must represent our community.  

Submissions are anonymous and you can fill in the (very short) form for as many wonderful humans as you'd like to nominate, one form per nomination.  This form will be open til **May 24, 2020**.

So, please, share 
* your pie in the sky picks
* your mentor from your local user group
* someone who has advocated for open source outside of traditional tech
* someone who has worked on bringing open source to traditionally proprietary-only models
* someone who has challenged social norms in open source
* someone who has lifted others up who have challenged those norms
* your tinker friend
* your friend known for <s>shitposting</s> clever tweeting
* someone in your office who recently showed you a shortcut through your favorite tools

And anyone else you think would make a terrific guest of honor at our community-focused open source conference!  You can let us know [right here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpDCLYLXC4OecykkvhotT1XboOFOZ22X-OyM4go6EzLW95gg/viewform).  SeaGL will take place virtually and all over the world, **November 13 & 14 2020**.
