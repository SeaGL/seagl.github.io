SeaGL condemns racism in all its forms, systemic, personal, and otherwise.  The organizers of SeaGL recognize the ongoing harm being done to the Black community and seek to support Black members of our community directly.  To that end, we have allotted honoraria for all Black speakers at SeaGL 2020.  We are also looking into the possibility of scholarships or other monetary support mechanisms for Black members of the FLOSS world.  We are currently strategizing how best to support and amplify our sister technical organizations who focus on non-white members of our community — we welcome [your suggestions](mailto:participate@seagl.org) of organizations to partner with and support!

In addition, we strive to not only make our community inclusive, but also to enforce BETTER behavior from our white community members.  None of us are free from blame, including the nearly all-white organizing staff, and we are redoubling our efforts to combat institutional racism in the tech industry. Our goal is for SeaGL to be an equitable conference by seeking out BIPOC voices, and supporting the Black FLOSS community in every way we can.

Furthermore, we condemn in the strongest of terms, the actions of the Seattle Police Department's unprovoked violence against the people of Seattle, particularly versus its Black community. We wholeheartedly support the collaborative spirit of the Capitol Hill protests. Our priority has always been to underserved and underprivileged communities, and we want to ensure that for anyone attending SeaGL, or participating in SeaGL-adjacent activities, there is agreement on this point.  We recognize that all actions are political, and we will continue to stand by our Code of Conduct in our continuing effort to make SeaGL as free from racism as possible.

Thank you,  
SeaGL Staff
