SeaGL is a great annual free software conference in Seattle. 
The [2019 schedule][SeaGL_2019_schedule] is ready for perusal.
Like most community run conferences, SeaGL offers many extra features aside from excellent keynotes, conference talks and tutorials.

Now in it's seventh year, SeaGL even added two new features last year: TeaGL and daycare.

TeaGL is the SeaGL Tea Swap, offered during the Saturday afternoon break.
Participants are encouraged to bring some favorite teas to share and discuss with others.
Hot water is available to try teas on the spot.

Last year a sponsor wanted to provide daycare at the conference, so SeaGL added a new feature.
The sponsor paid a commercial daycare service to come in both days.
Daycare is one of the few SeaGL activities that required non-anonymous registration to attend SeaGL.

SeaGL volunteers work to respect the privacy of attendees ( email <participate@SeaGL.org> to volunteer ).
Registration and conference participation are as anonymous as practical.
Attendees don't need to divulge personal data or use proprietary software to register.
Attendees can even register the day of at SeaGL.
The registration table is at the main entrance into the exhibition hall.
You can [pre-register][SeaGL_2019_registration] if you'd like.
It helps with attendee estimation.

The exhibition hall has tables for conference sponsors and for community groups.
It is also where activities like snack breaks and TeaGL take place.

Some features such as daycare, snack breaks, and complementary lunch depend on organizational sponsorship.
There is no registration fee, but SeaGL accepts individual sponsorship.
If you or your company are interested in sponsoring SeaGL, please contact the sponsorship committee, <sponsor@SeaGL.org>.

SeaGL has a strong hallway track where attendees chat with presenters and each other.
Conversations take place before and after talks, in the exhibition hall and during social activities such as lunch and TeaGL.
The conversations often take place in the hallways of the college, hence the nickname.

Speaking of the college, SeaGL continues to benefit from Seattle Central College's (SCC) generous hosting.
The college provides an auditorium for the keynotes, classrooms for the talks and a room for the exhibition hall.
SCC also has gender free bathrooms.

The college is across the street from Seattle's Jimi Hendrix statue.
More importantly for the plain text geeks among us, SCC is on Pine St in the pine mail program's home town.
The street name has not been changed to Alpine to reflect full free version of the program.
Pine Street is easy to spot, just outside the college there's a rainbow crosswalk at Pine and Broadway.

SeaGL wraps up with a conference reception Saturday night.
The reception has snacks and drinks.
SeaGL makes sure there are vegetarian food options and non-alcoholic drink options.
The reception also has awards and a prize drawing.
Will you be the one to win the plush seagull this year?

The reception might also have activities such lightning talks, game shows, or even lightning talk karaoke.
The SeaGL planning committee has worked the last couple years to have more chat time at the reception, extending the hallway track.
Show up to find out what's on the schedule this year.
