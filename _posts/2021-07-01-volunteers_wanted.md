SeaGL is a community-run conference.
That means we need *your* help!
There are so many ways you can help, but here are a few ideas:

* Volunteer Committee co-chair to help with coordinating volunteers during the event.
* Sysadmin and SREs to help run the infrastructure that keeps us online.
* Developers to help connect the pieces together. In particular, we're looking with folks with [OSEM](https://osem.io/) or Rails experience.
* More stuff, probably

If any of these sound interesting—or if you have other ideas we haven't thought of—see the [Get Involved](/get_involved) page to join us.
As always, the [Code of Conduct](/code_of_conduct.html) applies to all volunteers, speakers, attendees, and sponsors.
Thanks for your help making SeaGL 2021 the best one yet!
