Speaker Lance Albertson answers a few questions from SeaGL:

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your
background?

I am a native of Northeast Kansas and lived most of my life in the wonderful
sunflower state. I grew up on a corn/soybeans farm near Hiawatha, KS where my
family farms around 1800 acres. I attended Kansas State University and got a
degree in Agriculture Technology Management. I also received minors in
Agronomy and Computer Science at K-State.

In June of 2007, I took a huge leap of faith and moved to Oregon. I left my
whole family and most of my friends behind to take on a dream job at Oregon
State University. Currently I'm the Director at the OSU Open Source Lab and
help make sure important open source projects keep their servers running!

I've also been involved with the Ganeti project off and on over the years.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an
idea of what we might expect?

This will be a combination of a historical overview of FOSS hosting over
the past 10-15 years, how hosting has changed at the OSL and where I think
things are going as far as hosting for FOSS projects. It will largely be
focused on how this impacts the future of FOSS hosting at the OSL and where we
are thinking about going.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If
not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

Yes! The only expectation or impression I have is that it will be a high-impact,
but low-key event with key people from the FOSS ecosystem.
