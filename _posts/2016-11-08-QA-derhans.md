der.hans gives his talk titled, "MySQL for the system administrator: !DBA MySQL goodness" on [Saturday afternoon.](https://osem.seagl.org/conference/seagl2016/program/proposal/242)

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?


A: I've mostly been a sysadmin for many years, but have also been a full-time developer, managed IT and engineering teams, taught at a community college, pretended to be a DBA and generally tried to automate myself out of a job. I annually do not set myself on fire.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?


A: Pinatas. We should definitely have pinatas. They would be great. Since we just had candy fest the presentation will instead cover database stuff from a system administrator's perspective. Leveraging the CLI, automating, restorals, usernames longer than 16 characters and generally keeping our standard sysadminny toolchest.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

A: Yes, this is my first SeaGL. Last year I ventured a bit further north for LFNW, then visited some friends in Seattle.

This year I look forward to catching up with conference friends and also meeting new people. The schedule has some great presentations and I'm certain the hallway track is marvelous.

As a desert dweller I'm also looking forward to the free water from the sky thing that I've heard so much about.

Q: nomyon6swobanon (nom-yon-SIX-swob-an-on)?

A: rherhothkufibfo (rher-hoth-kuf-ib-fo)

There's no need for security questions and answers to make sense :)
