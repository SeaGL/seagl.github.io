Thank you to all who submitted a proposal for SeaGL 2025!  We're so delighted at the caliber of ideas we have recieved this year.

## Percentage breakdown for proposals by track

We would like to share a little peek behind the curtain on the distribution of topics this year.  In total, there were 90 proposal submissions with the following counts for each track:

* Cloud and Infrastructure (27)
* Languages and Tools (14)
* Open-source AI and Data Science (10)
* Community and Culture (8)
* Security and Privacy (7)
* Open-source Careers (6)
* Systems and Platforms (8)
* Education (5)
* Performance Art (2)
* Everything Else (2)
* Hardware (1)

Although Cloud and Dev tools led the way, the magic was in the diversity of ideas: from hard-hitting security deep dives to whimsical explorations of performance art, we saw a collaborative mix that spanned the practical, the social, and the creative. 

## Mask Policy

We’ve taken masking seriously and are proud of our community’s care for one another. This year, with only 3 out of 90 proposals requesting a masked room, we’ve decided to lift our general mask policy while continuing to support speakers' sessions with their masking preferences.

## Looking ahead

The Programming & Flow Committee is currently organizing the review process, with evaluations continuing through mid-August. We plan to notify all proposers of their proposal status by the beginning of September.

* August 1st - August 15th: Reviewers will vote on proposals asynchronously
* August 15th - September 1st: Schedule call with reviewers to go over reviewed proposals
* September 1st - Speaker notifications


## FOSSY
SeaGL will will be participating in the [third Free and Open Source Software Yearly (FOSSY)](https://2025.fossy.us/) conference in Portland, OR this year.  If you’ll be at the event anytime between July 31st and August 3rd, please be sure to stop by our booth and say hello!
