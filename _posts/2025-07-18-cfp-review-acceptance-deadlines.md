Thank you to all who submitted a proposal for SeaGL 2025!  We're so excited for the caliber of ideas we have recieved this year.

## Percentage breakdown for proposals by track

We would like to share a little peek behind the curtain on the distribution of topics this year.  

* Cloud and Infrastructure (35%)
* Languages and Tools (16%)
* Open-source AI and Data Science (11%)
* Community and Culture (8%)
* Security and Privacy (8%)
* Open-source Careers (7%)
* Systems and Platforms (5%)
* Education (5%)
* Performance Art (2%)
* Everything Else (2%)
* Hardware (1%)

Although Cloud and Dev tools led the way, the magic was in the diversity of ideas: from hard-hitting security deep dives to whimsical explorations of performance art, we saw a collaborative mix that spanned the practical, the social, and the creative. 

## Looking ahead

The Programming & Flow Committee is currently organizing the review process, with evaluations continuing through mid-August. We plan to notify all proposers of their proposal status by Monday, September 1st.
