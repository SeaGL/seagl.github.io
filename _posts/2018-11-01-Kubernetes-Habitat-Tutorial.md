Interested in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)? Curious about [Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh)? You're in luck! Thanks to IBM and Chef you can learn them for free!

Join us on **November 8th, the day before SeaGL starts**, for a workshop at hosted in the Chef offices in Seattle. You'll learn the basics of Kubernetes and how to get great results with Habitat in a Kubernetes cluster. Ideally you'll come out excited and confident to use Kubernetes and Habitat in your own projects. Thanks to IBM donating a robust public Kubernetes cluster (which will be available for a month), you'll even be able to practice what you learn after the tutorial is done!
