SeaGL is only two weeks away! We are therefore thrilled to be able to share that Ernie Smith
will be our fourth and final keynote speaker!

Ernie Smith is the editor of Tedium, and an active internet snarker. Between
his many internet side projects, he finds time to hang out with his wife Cat,
whoâ€™s funnier than he is.
