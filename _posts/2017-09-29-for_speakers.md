Hello, SeaGL (or other conference!) speakers! Our big event is only a week away, so here's some information to help you prepare and be ready to go when you arrived.

### A/V details

All rooms will have HDMI connectors (though a few may also have VGA). Please come prepared with whatever adapters you'll need to hook up your laptop to the HDMI connector. If you forget your adapter, don't worry. We'll have a few on hand, just in case.

### Recording your talk

Due to some administrative changes, we got a later start on organising the event than usual this year. Because of that we're unable to record the 2017 SeaGL sessions. We don't want to lose all of that great content, though.

We encourage all speakers to record their own talks and make them available online (more on that in a moment). Regardless of the platform you use for presenting, we have instructions for you:

* [Linux](https://opensource.com/business/15/11/how-record-screencasts)
* [Mac](https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2016/12/04/how-to-record-a-presentation-screencast-video-using-quicktime/)
* [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/183231/how-to-record-your-desktop-and-create-a-screencast-on-windows/) 

The Windows instructions also include details for using [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) (which is Free software) to record your screencast. These instructions will work for _any platform_ where you can run OBS (read: pretty much all of them).

The room moderator for your talk may not be familiar with the recording instructions for your platform, so **please test this out ahead of time** to make sure you know how to do it.

Out of respect for everyone else using the conference wifi, we ask that you not attempt to live stream your presentation.

### Sharing your slides, video, etc.

Once you've recorded your talk, what do you do with it? Or with your slides? 

You could upload the video to YouTube and the slides to SlideShare, and if that's your preference that's great. But we encourage you to upload the video and the slides together to a single item at [Internet Archive](https://archive.org).

Here are [instructions for uploading a video to the Archive](https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2016/07/25/uploading-a-video-to-internet-archive/). The exact same instructions will work for slides or any other digital material you wish to share.

If you upload your video and/or slides to Internet Archive, please include `seagl2017` as a subject tag. That will make it easier for us to locate your material and share it around.

### Presentation tips

Our friends at [opensource.com](https://opensource.com) have just published an article titled [7 best practices for giving a conference talk](https://opensource.com/article/17/9/7-best-practices-giving-conference-talk).

If you've never presented at a conference before, or even if you have but are looking to improve your presentation performance, this article will help you out.
