Thank you so much for sticking with us through SeaGL 2020!  We'll be announcing more with videos and other content from last year soon, but the big announcement here is that we are gearing up for year NINE of SeaGL! **SeaGL 2021 will be Friday, November 5 and Saturday, November 6, 2021!**

We are very close to decided on doing another fully virtual conference, which genuinely exceeded the highest of any of our expectations, but depending on how vaccinations go, there may be some kind of hybrid option.  This is undecided, but we are working on setting a date to decide by, not later than by summer 2021.

Please reach out if you'd like to help with a well-defined, well-supported volunteer role as we ramp up to this year's conference, at participate@seagl.org.  Many of the volunteers have been helping with the conference for many years, so you'll be joining an established team of people who care about free software and community in equal measure!

Thank you & stay tuned!
