SeaGL speaker Lee Fisher shares information about his upcoming UEFI
presentation:

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your 
background?

I've been working on computers for many years, mostly at the OS level,
more recently at the firmware level. I started with a Commodore 64,
started working on AT&T UNIX and DEC VAX/VMS systems. These days I use
Debian, and other FOSS OSes, and focus on \*nix-based firmware, Open
Hardware, open source firmware, and FOSS.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an
idea of what we might expect?

Learning some of the threats that UEFI exposes, and some of the
existing open source tools you can use to test your firmware for signs
of attacks. I'll be focusing on tools like CHIPSEC, FirmWare Test
Suite (FWTS), BIOS Interface Test Suite (BITS), UEFItool, UEFI
Firmware Parser, and some other tools, as well as the Yocto-based LUV
(Linux UEFI Validation) distro, and it's LUV-live release.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If
not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

I've been to all of the SeaGLs, exhibiting at community booths, Free
Geek Seattle, TA3M Seattle booths. It was rather small at first, but
has had some nice presentations. It has been getting bigger each year,
I'm hoping for 200 people, at least.
