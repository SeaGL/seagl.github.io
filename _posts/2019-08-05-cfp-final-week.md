_The [CFP](https://seagl.org/news/2019/06/25/CFP-open.html) closes August 11 at midnight Pacific time!_

Hi folks, a quick update from your Program Committee that we have just SIX DAYS left in 2019's SeaGL Call for Proposals!  We want to hear from you, so please get those submissions in, better sooner than later!

A point of clarification, the CFP itself says that the slots are 30m-60m, but in fact the talk length is 20m to 50m, which includes time for questions.  That ten minute difference you notice between 30/60 and 20/50 is so that we have plenty of time to turn the rooms over between talks and get the next speaker situated as smoothly as possible.  Thank you!

If you have any questions about the CFP, please join us on at #seagl on irc.freenode.net, and you can email us at cfp-help@seagl.org.
