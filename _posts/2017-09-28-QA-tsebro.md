Tony Sebro gives his talk titled, "ROI: Return on Inclusion" on [Friday afternoon](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2017/program/proposals/372).

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?
 
A: Hi, I'm Tony Sebro.  I currently serve as General Counsel of Software Freedom Conservancy, a public charity that educates, empowers, and defends communities that develop ethical technology.  I'm also an organizer of Outreachy, an initiative that provides paid internships for people from groups underrepresented in tech to get introduced to free
and open source software.

I live in Harlem with my wife, Beth, and my son, Ezra.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?

A: I plan to discuss how FLOSS communities benefits from investing in promoting diversity.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?
 
A: This is my first time -- and, it will be my first time attending a community-organized conference.  I look forward to connecting with other attendees and learning more about how these events are organized.

Q: The Conservancy sounds great! Is there any way that our readers can support it's work?

A: Conservancy is a public charity; we depend on the public's generosity to carry on our work. If you'd like to support Conservancy, [become a Conservancy Supporter!](https://sfconservancy.org/supporter).
