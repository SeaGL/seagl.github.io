We're excited to share the first part of the SeaGL 2021 program with you—our keynote speakers!

Taking the virtual stage this year are:

* Marie Nordin
* Christine & Morgan Lemmer-Webber
* Elana Hashman
* Cory Doctorow

Some of these names are new to SeaGL and some have spoken here before.
But all of them will be giving great talks that you don't want to miss.

As in years past, the Program Committee selected keynote speakers from *your* nominations.
We thank everyone who gave us suggestions.

For the other talks, all speakers have been notified.
Once we have confirmation, we'll be able to share the schedule with you.
We can't wait to see you online November 5–6!
