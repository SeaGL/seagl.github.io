We are excited to announce that Shauna Gordon-McKeon, the main organizer of
OpenHatch's [Open Source Comes to Campus events](https://campus.openhatch.org/),
and Richard M. Stallman, GNU's Project leader, will deliver the keynote
addresses at the 2015 Seattle GNU/Linux Conference.

Besides her work bringing open source tools to some of the world's top
universities, Shauna's numerous contributions to the open source community are
listed on the [Open Hatch](https://campus.openhatch.org/about/) site:

>She's also a freelance programmer, researcher, organizer and writer. She's
>worked for the MIT Media Lab and Civic Commons, among others, and volunteers
>with the Sunlight Foundation and the Open Science Collaboration.

Richard's three decades of activism are summed up on the [Free Software
Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board/) website:

>Since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time in political advocacy
>for free software, and spreading the ethical ideas of the movement, as well as
>campaigning against both software patents and dangerous extension of copyright
>laws. Before that, Richard developed a number of widely used programs that are
>components of GNU, including the original Emacs, the GNU Compiler Collection,
>the GNU symbolic debugger (gdb), GNU Emacs, and various others.
