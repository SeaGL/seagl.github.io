Part of what makes SeaGL so special are the social events.
They’re a chance to make new friends and catch up with old ones.
This year, we’re bringing in a few new events to go with the returning favorites.
Thanks so much to everyone who's helping us bring the fun!

All times below are in [Pacific Daylight Time](https://time.is/compare/0800AM_5_Nov_2021_in_Seattle)

No registration is required for any of these events although you may want to check in on ingredients lists next week.
The food and beverage programming doesn't require you to have everything to follow along, but it is a little more fun that way. 

Lastly, our [Code of Conduct](https://seagl.org/code_of_conduct) applies to the social events.
We expect folks to behave respectfully (but not seriously!) during our social events so that everyone can enjoy themselves.
Daytime events should be considered all-ages, while the later evening events might be a bit more PG-13.

We can't wait to see you online next week!
