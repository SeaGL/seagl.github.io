Thanks to all of you who spoke, sponsored, volunteered, ran a booth and/or attended our second year! We couldn't have done it without you. We had more people at SeaGL this year by 11am on Friday than both days last year combined. We'd especially like to thank those of you who invited your friends and colleagues to join us this year. Word of mouth is absolutely critical to the success of a newer conference. Make sure you join our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/seagl_announce">mailing list</a> so we can keep you in the loop again for 2015.

Now before we completely move on into the sunshiney possibilities for next year, we'd like to hear from you. What went well this year and what would you like to see us change for next time? We want SeaGL to be your favorite conference and the only way for us to do that is for <b>you</b> to tell us how to keep improving. Please take a minute to drop us a quick email {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }} with "Feedback 2014" in the subject. We would really appreciate it!

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions, either by
emailing {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }}
or visiting us on IRC on
[Freenode]({{ site.custom.url.irc.network }}) in
[#seagl]({{ site.custom.url.irc.webchat }}).
