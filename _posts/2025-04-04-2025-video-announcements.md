We are thrilled to announce that the videos from last year's conference, are now live on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/seagl?and[]=year%3A%222024%22)! Or, directly from the [Seagl.Org 2024 Archive](https://seagl.org/archive/2024). This milestone marks a significant achievement for our volunteer-run organization, and we couldn't be more grateful to finally share these valuable resources with the open source community.

As a volunteer-driven conference, we rely on the dedication and hard work of our team members. Unfortunately, this means that sometimes tasks take longer to complete than we'd like. In this case, it took us a while to publish the videos from last year's conference because, for a long time, we had a single person working tirelessly behind the scenes to make it happen. We appreciate their efforts and apologize for the delay.

A special shout-out to the Internet Archive for being our host. Your platform has allowed us to share the wealth of knowledge created by our community, and for that, we are incredibly grateful.

Regrettably, we encountered some technical issues during last year's conference, which resulted in a couple of videos not being recorded properly. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the understanding of our attendees and speakers.

However, we're committed to learning from these experiences and improving our processes. This year, we'll be addressing these technical issues to ensure that all presentations are recorded and available for everyone to enjoy.

As we look ahead, we're excited to announce that the Call for Presentations (CfP) for SeaGL 2025 will be opening soon! If you're interested in sharing your knowledge and expertise with the open source community, stay tuned for the CfP announcement. We welcome submissions from industry experts and enthiusiasts alike, and we can't wait to see what exciting topics and ideas you'll be sharing with us.

Once again, thank you to our volunteers, the Internet Archive, and everyone who attended SeaGL last year. Your support and participation are what make this conference possible, and we're honored to be a part of the free/libre/open source community.
