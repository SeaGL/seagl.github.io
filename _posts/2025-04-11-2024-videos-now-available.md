We are thrilled to announce that last year's conference videos are now available on the [SeaGL Archive](https://seagl.org/archive/2024)! They can also be accessed directly via our [Internet Archive collection](https://archive.org/details/seagl?and[]=year%3A%222024%22). This release marks a significant achievement for our volunteer-run organization, and we couldn't be more excited to share these valuable resources with the free / libre / open source community.

As a volunteer-driven conference, we rely on the dedication and hard work of our team members. Sometimes this means that tasks take longer to complete than we'd like. In this case, we had a single person working tirelessly behind the scenes. We are extremely grateful for their efforts and appreciate your patience.

A special shout-out to the Internet Archive for hosting our video archives. Their platform has allowed us to share the vast wealth of knowledge created by our community, and for that, we are incredibly thankful.

Regrettably, we encountered some technical issues during last year's conference which resulted in a couple of videos not being recorded properly. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the understanding of our attendees and speakers.

We are committed to learning from these experiences and improving our processes. We've already begun addressing last year's issues to ensure that all presentations are cleanly captured and made available for everyone to enjoy.

Looking ahead, we're excited to announce that the Call for Presentations (CfP) for SeaGL 2025 will be opening soon. If you're interested in sharing your knowledge and expertise with the FLO community, stay tuned for the CfP announcement. As usual, we welcome submissions from industry experts and enthusiasts alike. We can't wait to see what exciting topics and ideas you'll be sharing with us!

Once again, thank you to our volunteers, the Internet Archive, and everyone who attended SeaGL last year. Your support and participation are what make this conference possible, and we're honored to be a part of such a thoughtful community!
