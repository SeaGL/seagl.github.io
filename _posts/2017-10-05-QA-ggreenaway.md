Gareth Greenaway gives his talk titled, "Your Solution Is Not My Problem" on [Saturday afternoon](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2017/program/proposals/353).

<i>Gareth is also one of our illustrious party emcees! He might even wear a top hat!</i>

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?
     
A: My name is Gareth Greenaway and I've been an active free & open source user & supporter for over 20 years.   I'm currently a senior software engineer at SaltStack where I have the fortunate privilege to spend my days writing open source code.  Prior to that I've been a DevOps engineer at various companies. I am also an occasional co-host for the FLOSS Weekly podcast.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?
     
A: When I've attended various talks at conferencesin the past, particular those of a technical nature, it can be tempting to take the ideas & concepts in their entirety.  When often times those solutions are crafted to solve a particular problem in a particular environment.  It can also be tempting to think that to order to be successful those presented solutions must be emulated completely.  My hope is that this talk will illustrate that this isn't the case.
     
Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?
     
A: This will be my fifth SeaGL and I've really enjoyed attending since the first event.  It's been amazing watching it grow over the years and I always look forward to see everyone each year. 

A: Question: What are you most looking forward to about visiting Seattle again?  Answer: One of my favorite parts about travling to different conferences is experiencing the different climates meeting the different people.
