Since SeaGL is virtual this year we've been challenged on how to provide social meal events.

The word "trebuchet" might have been spoken, but interstate lauches require more counterweight than we were willing to lift.
There are probably also laws against interstate food flinging.

Delivery by carrier seagull might be possible, but let's face it, only the empty containers would arrive.
Heck, just trying to fit them with basket french fry harnesses probably busts a bunch of safety regulations.

In the end the user experience committee decided on revision controlled recipes for food you can make at home.

These recipes do not require cooking cooking and can be made in 30 minute prep time.
Choose what you'd like to make and gather the ingredients ahead of time.

Check out our [https://github.com/SeaGL/social-cookbook](social-cookbook) and join us Friday and Saturday for a volunteer run, community oriented, FLOSS conference.

Let us know if you'd like to volunteer for day of assistance.
