Hello and welcome to 2020!  First, a bit of housekeeping.  We have confirmed dates for this fall (OUR EIGHTH YEAR!!!) and those dates are **November 13 & 14 2020**.  SeaGL (the Seattle GNU/Linux conference) is Seattle's grassroots free/libre/open source software, hardware, and culture summit. Founded in 2013, SeaGL now features over 50 talks, four keynotes, and the Cascadia Community Builder Award each year. Join speakers and participants from around the world for Seattle's FREE, as in freedom and coffee, GNU/Linux conference.

If you would like to help with this entirely volunteer-run, no-profit conference, please email us at participate@seagl.org and we'll get talking soon about the details for the coming year's conference.

Please find within our long-awaited videos of 2019's fabulous keynotes, who were in no order, Abigail Cabunoc Mayes, Benjamin Mako Hill, Sage Sharp, and finally, Lisha Sterling!

Abigail's keynote described a view into stewarding open source communities with a lens on learning and open leadership and open organizational design. [Open By Design](https://archive.org/details/openbydesign)

Benjamin's keynote describes a shift from open source tools to private organizations profiting from the community and technical work done over decades.  [How Markets Co-opted Free Software's most Valuable Weapon]( https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/libreplanet-2018-keynote) (Note: Video is from a different event, but contains similar content with a higher production value)

Sage describes how to counter imposter syndrome on a cultural and systematic level, and the importance of including the very community members who need this support most. [Countering Imposter Syndrome Culture](https://archive.org/details/imposter_202001)

Lisha describes some of her work with Geeks Without Bounds and the limiting factor of corporate expression of power, pitted against activism, unions, and social justice.  [The Cost Of Freedom](https://archive.org/details/thecostoffreedom_202001)

Stay tuned this week for the next blog post on all recorded talks!
