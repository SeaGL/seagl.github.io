Thank you to all who submitted a proposal for SeaGL 2025!  We're so delighted at the caliber of ideas we received this year!

## Looking Ahead

The Programming & Flow Committee has begun the review process, with evaluations continuing through mid-August.  We plan to notify all proposers of their proposal status by the beginning of September.

- **August 1st - August 15th:** Reviewers vote on proposals asynchronously
- **August 15th - September 1st:** Reviewers meet to decide which presentations are accepted
- **September 1st:** - Speakers are notified via email

## Track Breakdown

Here is a peek behind the curtain at the distribution of topics proposed this year.  In total, there were 90 submissions with the following counts for each track:

* Cloud and Infrastructure (27)
* Languages and Tools (14)
* Open-source AI and Data Science (10)
* Community and Culture (8)
* Systems and Platforms (8)
* Security and Privacy (7)
* Open-source Careers (6)
* Education (5)
* Performance Art (2)
* Everything Else (2)
* Hardware (1)

Although Cloud and Dev tools led the way, part of SeaGL's magic is made by the wide diversity of ideas shared.  From hard-hitting security deep dives to whimsical explorations of performance art; we enjoy hosting a collaborative mix spanning the practical, the social, and the creative!

## Mask Policy

The SeaGL team continues to take health and safety concerns seriously and we are proud of our community’s care for one another.  This year we asked for speaker preferences and with only 3 out of 90 proposals requesting a masked room, we've decided to lift our mandatory room masking requirement.  However, we will continue to support sessions where the speaker request masks and we will continue to provide masks to anyone requesting them.

Details can be found on the [health and safety policy](https://seagl.org/health_and_safety_policy) page of our website.  Please note that we will continue to monitor risk levels.  Any policy updates that we publish before the event will not be less-restrictive.

## FOSSY

SeaGL will be at the third annual [Free and Open Source Software Yearly (FOSSY)](https://2025.fossy.us/) conference in Portland, OR this year.  If you’ll be at the event anytime between July 31st and August 3rd, please be sure to stop by our booth and say hello!
