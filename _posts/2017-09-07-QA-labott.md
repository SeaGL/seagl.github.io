Laura Abbott gives her talk titled, "Creating Fresh Kernels" on [Saturday afternoon.](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2017/program/proposals/261)

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?

A: My name is Laura Abbott and I'm a kernel developer. I started out doing kernel development for Android phones but these days I'm one of two people employed by Red Hat to maintain the Fedora kernel.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?

A: Kernels, kernels, kernels!

There's a lot of different ways of delivering a kernel to end-users. If you've ever wondered why some distributions choose to deliver specific kernel versions or why you never seem to get brand new kernels, this talk is for you.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

A: I attended SeaGL last year to help with the Fedora booth. I enjoyed hearing all the different ways people used Linux and what they wanted to accomplish.

Q: Is this talk for everyone?

A: YES! Come and learn about kernels.
