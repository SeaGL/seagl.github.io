Lucy gives her talk titled, "Linux Jargon: From AFK to Zero Day" on [Friday morning.](https://osem.seagl.org/conference/seagl2016/program/proposal/126)

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?

A:  My name is Lucy Wyman, and I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer for Puppet where I automate tests and develop testing infrastructure for puppet orchestrator, PCP, and PE core.  I graduated from Oregon State University with a BS in Computer Science in June 2016, where I worked as a Front-End Engineer for the OSU Open Source Lab and helped run the OSU Linux Users Group.  In my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends, hiking, experiencing new things, and enjoying a wide variety of podcasts, tv shows, blogs, books, and other media.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?

A: There's a lot of jargon in the tech industry which can be intimidating, ambiguous, or just down-right confusing. My talk covers general technical jargon, from command line tools to cultural touchstones, so that you can be in the know about what bikeshedding, PGP, GEB, and "hunter2" are. 
 
Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations?  If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

A: I think this is my second or third SeaGL.  I think of SeaGL as a community of folks passionate about open source (not companies looking to advertise to the open source crowd), sharing ideas, tools, new technologies, and other useful information.  Mostly there are a lot of people I look forward to seeing each year.

Q: How did you get involved in the Open Source community?

A: During the first few weeks at Oregon State University, I stumbled upon the Linux Users Group at one of the find-a-club events. I wanted to be as knowledgeable and clever as the people I met there, so I installed Mint and stuck around, eventually becoming the club's vice president. Since then open source has been a big part of my identity as a software engineer and I advocate for openness and collaboration in each project I join.
