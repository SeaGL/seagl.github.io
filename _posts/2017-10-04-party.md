Join us for a post-SeaGL reception on Saturday evening, right after the event, aka 6:15pm, at the Silver Cloud Hotel on Capitol Hill. The event is all-ages and runs until 10pm. This year's entertainment will be lightning talks and slide karaoke led by our most excellent emcees; Gareth Greenaway and VM Brasseur.  

We'll have some snacks; including stuff for our vegan and gluten-free pals. There will also be drinks, including [delicious non-alcoholic options](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/alcohol-and-inclusivity-planning-tech-events-with-non-alcoholic-options). Expect a convivial, but not ear-bleedingly loud environment. 

We'll have door prizes from the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and [NoStarch](https://www.nostarch.com/).Thanks to all of our [fabulous sponsors](http://seagl.org/sponsors/2017.html) for allowing us to make SeaGL and Saturday night's party free as in cost.
