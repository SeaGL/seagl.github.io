Brain Raiter gives his talk titled, "Introduction to the Godot Game Engine" on [Friday afternoon](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2017/program/proposals/389).

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?

A: Hello, world: I'm Brian. I've been a professional programmer for most of my adult life, and a recreational programmer for even longer.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?

A: I'm going to give a whirlwind introduction to Godot, a very cool free-software game engine. By the end of the talk you'll be ready to fire up Godot yourself and start using it to build your own game.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

A: This is my fifth time attending SeaGL. Talks cover a wide range of topics, given by all kinds of people and all kinds of Linux users. I especially appreciate SeaGL's commitment to free software and inclusiveness.

Q: What's the first computer game you ever played?

A: Mainframe "Star Trek", on an IBM S/36 where my father worked.
