DEADLINE is August 16th: Take a Minute to Nominate Someone Amazing! 

The second Cascadia Community Builder Award will be given this fall to a local person who has made an outstanding contribution to the free software movement. We are looking for someone who contributes -- either at work, as a volunteer or both -- to the adoption or creation of free and open source software. We are especially interested in hearing about work that brings FOSS to new communities and/or under-represented groups.

To nominate someone, send an email to {{ site.custom.a.email.award }} -- with the nominee's name in the subject line. Great nominations will include some links to the person's work and/or two or three sentences about why you find them inspiring. Thanks in advance for helping us honor a local community builder!

If you want to speak with us in real-time, come visit us on IRC on Freenode in #seagl.


Feel free to contact us if you have any questions, either by
emailing {{ site.custom.a.email.award }} or visiting us on IRC on
[Freenode]({{ site.custom.url.irc.network }}) in
[#seagl]({{ site.custom.url.irc.webchat }}).
