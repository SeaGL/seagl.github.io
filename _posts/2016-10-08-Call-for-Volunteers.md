SeaGL 2016 is just over a month away and we are looking for helpful people to volunteer!

This year's list of volunteer roles:
 - coffee/lunch team
 - expo hall monitors
 - floaters
 - party monitors
 - registration/check-in
 - room monitors
 - sign-wranglers

If you are interested, we are using a new tool which has more details on each role and available shifts.

Here's how it works:
 - 1. Click this link to go to our invitation page on SignUp.com: http://signup.com/go/7S3K6M
 - 2. Enter your email address: (You will NOT need to register an account on SignUp.com, though be wary of small checkboxes.)
 - 3. Sign up! Choose your spots - SignUp.com will send you an automated confirmation and reminders.

We will be hosting two orientations. Both will be remotely accessible; one is also in-person. The first will be held Thursday, November 3 at 12pm via conference call. The second will be held Wednesday, November 9 at 7pm at SCC and via conference call.

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions, either by emailing participate@seagl.org or visiting us on IRC on Freenode in #seagl.
