If you are interested, we are using a new tool which has more details on each role and available shifts.

Here's how it works:

1. Click this link to go to our invitation page on SignUp.com: <https://signup.com/go/7S3K6M>
1. Enter your email address: (You will NOT need to register an account on SignUp.com, though be wary of small checkboxes.)
1. Sign up! Choose your spots - SignUp.com will send you an automated confirmation and reminders.

We will be hosting two orientations. Both will be remotely accessible; one is also in-person. The first will be held Thursday, November 3 at 12pm via conference call. The second will be held Wednesday, November 9 at 7pm at SCC and via conference call.
