First, we would like to thank everyone who has taken time to submit a talk as part of our [Call For Proposals](https://seagl.org/news/2020/07/14/CFP-open.html).

With that said, we realize that these are not normal times. Many people have been (rightfully) distracted dealing with an international pandemic and fighting [against racism](https://seagl.org/news/2020/06/12/black-lives-matter.html). If you are like us, you might have a hard time believing that August has almost come to an end, and we have reached our previously announced CFP deadline of August 19. Hopefully, you have already submitted your proposals, but if not, there is no need to worry.

**We are extending our Call For Proposals until Wednesday, September 9 11:59pm PDT**

Our hope is that this will allow everyone ample time to submit their talk proposals (or to submit additional proposals). We will also be continuing to offer CFP Office Hours every Wednesday at noon PDT in #seagl on irc.freenode.net. You can also email <cfp-help@seagl.org> at any time for help/guidance with your proposal. We are here to help.
