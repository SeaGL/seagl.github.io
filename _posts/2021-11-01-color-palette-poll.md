Over the last few months, we've collected name suggestions for our official color palette.
Sure, you could refer to the colors by their RGB values, but wouldn't friendly names be so much better?
Well now it's time to see which names are the best.
[Vote now](https://forms.gle/ZD8pHVgZKUFwjz3r9) to select your favorites.

Voting is open through noon Pacific on Saturday, November 6.
The winning names will be announced in the closing remarks on Saturday afternoon.
Thanks for your input and we can't wait to see you [online](https://attend.seagl.org) this weekend!
