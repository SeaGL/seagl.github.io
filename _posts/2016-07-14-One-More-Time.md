Office hours -- they're both fun and good for you!

SeaGL is committed to supporting new and local voices. This means we very much want to help you turn your draft or idea into a polished submission by giving you feedback and suggestions in realtime on IRC. Last year we hosted two online proposal help sessions and this year we've had five sessions over the last three weeks. The number of submissions has been increasing each week, often during the actual office hours. Go early birds!

But, we know that some of you are procrastinators. (Some of us are too, although we try to keep each other in check...) Anyway, we've scheduled one final, four-hour, marathon proposal help session on the day before our CFP closes. If that's when you'll be writing your proposal, then swing by #seagl on freenode and get help from our charismatic and knowledgeable volunteers.

* July 31st, 5-9pm (PDT)

If you aren't already an IRC user, you can still join our office hours. [Go to freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/) via any web browser. You’ll choose a nickname, type #seagl into the channel box, confirm that you aren’t a robot and then connect.

[Or submit your presentation](https://osem.seagl.org/conference/seagl2016/program/proposal/new) now.

**The CFP deadline is midnight PDT, August 1, 2016.**

Our talk format is generally 50 minutes of speaking followed by 10 minutes of questions, so one hour total.

Right now, since we're a relatively new community organized and non-profit event, we're unable to provide travel funding for speakers.


Feel free to contact us if you have any questions, either by
emailing {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }}
or visting us on IRC on
[Freenode]({{ site.custom.url.irc.network }}) in
[#seagl]({{ site.custom.url.irc.webchat }}).
