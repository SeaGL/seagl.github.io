Welcome to the first day of SeaGL 2021!  Please find the full [SeaGL 2021 program](), and you can read on for just today's schedule, for Friday, November 5, 2021.  As a reminder, SeaGL 2021 is completely [virtual]() for the second year in a row.  The conference is also completely "free as in tea" with no registration required.  Everyone is welcome to attend!

You can attend if you go to [attend.seagl.org](https://attend.seagl.org).  Live streams are also available at [seagl.org/watch](https://seagl.org/watch).

Normal talk blocks are 30m.  There are 20m for the talk, and 10m for optional Q&A as led by the Room Moderator.  The Moderator will read questions from the text chat audience for the speaker to answer.  There are 5 minute spaces between talks, which means that the talk blocks are listed as 45 minutes long.  There is no Q&A during Keynotes.

All times are listed in Pacific Daylight Time, which is UTC -07:00.  (note: the US time change happens the evening AFTER the conclusion of the conference on Saturday)
