Today we announce the schedule for SeaGL 2019!  November 15 and November 16 will be an amazing couple of days of talks, and we can't WAIT to see you there!

Please note, the room numbers have not been finalized, but when we get closer to the date of the conference, we'll have those ready for you.  So for now, they're "Room 1," "Room 2," etc.  We look forward to having these finalized within a couple weeks at most.
