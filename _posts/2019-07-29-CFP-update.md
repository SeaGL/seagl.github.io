_The [CFP](https://seagl.org/news/2019/06/25/CFP-open.html) closes August 11 at midnight Pacific time!_

We are JUST under only two weeks left in the 2019 [CFP](https://seagl.org/news/2019/06/25/CFP-open.html) for SeaGL!  We want to hear from YOU!  We are dedicated to supporting newer speakers, and we welcome speakers of **all backgrounds and levels of experience** – even if you’ve never spoken at a technical conference. If you’re excited about Free/Libre/Open technologies or communities, then we want to hear from you!

At a Free and Open Source Software conference, the depth and breadth of topics can be overwhelming!  So let us share some of the talks we'd like to see.  Tweet at us at @seagl if you have more ideas you'd like to see and we'll add to this, and be sure to come see us on #seagl on IRC if we can help you develop your ideas!

First, a few topics that we think would make great talks.
 * Hardware, specifically DIY IOT!  That is to say, "internet-of-things"-style hardware hacks with something like Arduino or Raspberri Pis which you use for automating your chicken coop, music setup, or something else?
 * Have you built a mechanical keyboard?  Do you want to help other people get started with mechanical keyboards?  This is an increasing number of folks' entry into hardware so our FOSS conference is a great place to give a talk on this topic!
 * The open source ecosystem in front-end!  We focus so much on open source in the operations/admin space but let's hear about what you're doing with non proprietary front end tools, like Glitch or Vue.js!
 * What are you working on in the FOSS education space?  How can we better support people who want to make some movements away from proprietary methods?

Got other questions about the CFP that we could help you with?  Email cfp-help@seagl.org.  We can't wait to see what you submit!
