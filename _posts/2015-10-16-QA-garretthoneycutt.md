Garrett Honeycutt talks with SeaGL about Test Driven Development:

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your
background?

I've been hacking \*nix based systems and spreading the word about free
software for over fifteen years. Previously I've worked on such things
as building core internet infrastructure at Speakeasy, creating mobile
media distribution platforms and as a professional services engineer
with Puppet Labs. At my company, [LearnPuppet.com](http://learnpuppet.com),
I consult and teach people around the world about automation with Puppet and
DevOps processes. At [Transforia](http://transforia.com), I am co-founder
and CTO where we lease fully managed, secure, GNU/Linux based laptops
and desktops. Besides submitting patches, I give back to the community
by speaking at user groups, conferences and co-organizing
[FOSSETCON](http://fossetcon.org) in Orlando.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an
idea of what we might expect?

Developers have long been using Test Driven Development (TDD) for
building applications. Now that SysAdmins are treating their
infrastructure as software, we must look to best practices in
development. This talk will explain how to implement TDD and gain
confidence through testing for system administrators.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If
not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

I had the good fortune to speak last year with the talk "Intro to Puppet
and Why Configuration Management is Important". I enjoy the atmosphere
of the conference taking place inside a school and the exceptionally
high quality of the other speakers.
