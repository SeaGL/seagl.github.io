Julia Kreger gives her talk titled, "How to get a cross-project feature landed in OpenStack: Or how I plotted to obtain success... " on [Saturday afternoon.](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2017/program/proposals/315)

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?

A: Hi, I'm Julia, and I might be crazy. Well, I guess that always remains to be determined. I've been interested in Linux and Open Source for about twenty years. I got my first job helping someone install Linux on a computer, which started my career in computer networking. Over time I drifted from networks, to systems, systems automation, and I've been in more of a development focused role for the past five years or so. I presently contribute to OpenStack Ironic and several other related projects, and I care deeply care about the communities I work in, because I see the difference I make in people's lives.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?

A: Attendees to my talk should really expect a down to earth, realistic kind of journey coupled with reflections. I really hope people enjoy it, and they leave with another way to look at cross-community problems and what might help solve them.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

A: This will be my first visit to SeaGL. I had hopes of trying to visit last year after a few of my friends that are local to Seattle all spoke highly of SeaGL, but timing just didn't work out. My impression of it is that it is a smaller local gathering as opposed to some of the huge regional conferences, and that it has a great cross-section of Open Source community enthusiasts.

Q: Are you excited?

A: I am really excited. I feel that local communities are the foundation of larger communities, and every time I have attended a smaller community event, while I feel awkward, I've had some of the best discussions and learned some of the most interesting things by people in that community.
