Christopher Aedo gives his talk titled, " Brewing Beer with Linux, Python and a RaspberryPi " on [Saturday afternoon.](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2017/program/proposals/278)

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?

A: I'm Christopher Aedo, my day job is developer advocate for IBM. That means I get to learn new technologies and experiment with stuff for work, but I'm also constantly doing that in my spare time too.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?

A: You can expect to learn the best way to feed yeast, how to suspend hops in liquid, and find out how I convinced IBM to pay me to brew beer.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

A: This is my first visit, and I'm expecting it to be one of the most fun but laid-back conferences I've been to.  I also expect to see tons of old friends there and make lots of new ones too.

Q: Who would you like to see deliver a keynote this year?

A: You read my mind when you picked [Rikki Endsley](https://seagl.org/news/2017/07/25/Keynote_Announce.html), I can't wait for that!
