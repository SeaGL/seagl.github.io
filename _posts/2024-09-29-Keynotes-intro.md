We are very pleased to announce our 2024 Seattle GNU/Linux conference keynote speakers:

## Christopher Neugebauer

Australian developer, speaker, and serial community conference organizer, who presently lives in the United States.

He serves as a Director of the Python Software Foundation, and is co-organizer of the acclaimed North Bay Python conference, a boutique one-track conference run in unusual venues — include an old vaudeville theater, and more recently a barn on a farm — in Petaluma, California.

Christopher is also a contributor on the open source Pants build system, helping make Python’s testing, correctness, and style tools accessible and fast for developers, no matter how big their codebase.

## Duane O'Brien

Duane is the Director of Collaborative Engineering at Capital One. His organization focuses on developing internal and external collaborative development practices through open source and InnerSource. He is the creator of the [FOSS Contributor Fund framework](https://github.com/indeedeng/FOSS-Contributor-Fund), and loves helping organizations get involved in funding and sustaining their open source dependencies. Duane is a force of chaotic good using his high stats in intelligence and charisma to advocate for the open source community. If you encounter him in forested areas, he will share his fire, drink, and philosophy.

One of the organizers of the Portland chapter of PyLadies, an international group of women Python coders, and also chaired (with a group of six) a small Python conference here in Portland called PyDX, which has morphed into the wonderful PyCascadia.  Past contributor and volunteer to SeaGL in 2020 and probably 2021.
