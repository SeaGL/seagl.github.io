**Come present a lightning talk at SeaGL!**

Are you attending SeaGL this year (you really should)? Are you passionate enough about something to talk about it for five minutes (of course you are)? Then you should propose a lightning talk!

This year the SeaGL lightning talks will take place during the conference party the evening of October 7th. We're looking for eight amusing and informative talks for that segment of the party entertainment.

### About lightning talks

Lighting talks are five minute talks. You may use as many (or as few) slides as you wish. 

SeaGL's attendees are fascinating and well-rounded individuals with a lot of different interests. Therefore SeaGL lightning talks may be on any topic whatsoever. There's no need to stick to technical matters.

There are three criteria for a SeaGL lightning talk:

1. The topic is interesting to the SeaGL audience.
1. You can present it in five minutes.
1. The presentation does not violate the [code of conduct](/code_of_conduct).

That's it! Pretty easy, really.

### Topic ideas

Lightning talks can be about anything which you think would hold the interest of the audience for a max of five minutes. For instance:

* How not to crash your drone
* What's the deal with international paper sizes?
* Your car is a computer which you can hack
* A travelogue of your trip touring Thai Buddhist temples
* An introduction to lactobacillus fermentation
* Mending for geeks: how to save your favorite clothes
* What the heck is this thing?! Bizarre tools of yesteryear
* Lost language: Modem AT Commands
* So you want to buy a house: What to expect
* How to mingle at parties and events

Technical talks, funny talks, WTF talks… If you can make it interesting, then we'd love a proposal about it.

### Talk selection criteria

The main SeaGL program had nine reviewers and a [well-documented list of selection criteria](/news/2017/08/17/CFP_selection_criteria).

The lightning talk selection criteria are going to be considerably more casual. The speaker committee will vote on proposals, then the final decisions and schedule will be made by the program chair. It's going to be a fairly laid back process, keeping with the fun but informative nature of lightning talks themselves.

### Proposal and public speaking resources

Never presented at a conference or meetup before? Presented but still not feeling confident? It's OK, even the most experienced conference presenters aren't necessarily confident at this stuff.

A lightning talk can be a great way to dip your toe into conference speaking. It's quick (so the pain of public speaking is over quickly). It's short (so you don't have to spend days crafting your talk). It's fun (you can talk about anything which interests you).

The [Public_Speaking](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking) repository has collected a lot of resources to help you level up in your conference presenting.

Pay particular attention to the [Proposing talks](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking#proposing-talks) section of this page. Follow these tips and your talk proposals will stand a better chance of being selected.

**PLEASE NOTE**: Whether your talk is accepted or not often doesn't have as much to do with how great your proposal is as it does with how many speaking slots the conference has available and the balance of the program the organisers need to craft. It's nothing personal: we just don't have enough time to accept all the great lightning talk proposals we receive.

Don't let that stop you from proposing! You can't win a race you don't even run, so [click here to propose a lightning talk.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfsTiGpEw3de8V9ZkEt6qcNqBf_YXAUgi8cLqTLIgRTLY4ODg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
