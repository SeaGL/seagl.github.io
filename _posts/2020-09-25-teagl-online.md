**UPDATE** - TeaGL signup deadline extended to Monday, October 19th, use the [TeaGL signup](https://gnu-cloud.yourownnet.cloud/apps/forms/qsiw2pCb5sKPPaCg) to participate in our first virtual TeaGL tea celebration! - **UPDATE**

If you're a SeaGL regular, or a SeaGL newbie who really loves trying new tea, this news is for you. The 3rd annual TeaGL is moving online, with a virtual tea time AND an online tea swap. The past two years, SeaGL community members have brought enough of their favorite tea (black, white, green, herbal, whatever!) to share, turning Saturday into the most relaxing (and caffeinated) day of the conference.

We're excited to bring this SeaGL favorite to the 2020 virtual conference in the form of tea
swapping. That's right: sign up to participate, and you will both send someone your favorite tea and
receive someone else's favorite.

If you'd like to participate [please sign up
here](https://gnu-cloud.yourownnet.cloud/apps/forms/qsiw2pCb5sKPPaCg) by **October 9th at 11:59pm**.
Concerned about privacy? We have an anonymi-tea mode that will ensure your TeaGL trade pal doesn't
know your name or address details. 

We're excited to continue this SeaGL tradition, and look forward to seeing what teas y'all bring to
the tea-ble. Until then, pinkies up!
