José speaks on Saturday. His talk is titled, "Juju: No more staying awake overnight, your cloud in just a couple taps (or clicks!): Learn how to deploy your own cloud in minutes

More details on his talk are [here!](https://osem.seagl.org/conference/seagl2016/program/proposal/145)


Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your
background?
 
 
A: I'm José Antonio Rey, a student from Peru. I started contributing to Open Source around 5 and a half years ago, with Ubuntu. Currently studying audiovisual production at University of Lima. I learnt all I know about FOSS online and through friends.

 
Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?
 

A: I know several of you, as sysadmins (or maybe just for fun!), have to deal with deploying software in servers. I've gone through the painful process of installing a piece of software I don't know, and spent hours and even days trying to get something to work. And then you get to the config files... what a mess. So much time lost, and so much stress on your plate! Want to move from spending hours to spending just a couple minutes? Deploying, let's say, big data software in the time it takes for you to brew a cup of coffee? Then you don't want to miss out ;)
 
 
Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations?
If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?
 
 
A: It is my first visit! I've always heard Seattle has a lot of rain, which I'm looking forward to. We don't have a lot of rain in Lima and I love it when I go somewhere that does. I hope SeaGL will be a great place for learning about new stuff and meeting new people in the Open Source world. I love community-ran conferences since they have a greater outreach to different communities, not only in the area, but all around the world, and bring people from all over together to celerate Open Source. I can't wait to get there!


Q: Do you have a pet llama in my backyard?


A: No, I don't even have a backyard!
