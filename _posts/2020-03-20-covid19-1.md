Hi everyone, we'd like to give an estimation of what comes for SeaGL during the global pandemic.  We are keeping a close eye on it and it may come to pass that we'll have to postpone or cancel SeaGL 2020, as so many conferences, like our sister conference Linux Fest Northwest, have had to do.

We will give several months' notice in the event we have to cancel.

However, we're not ready to make that call yet.  We will have more details soon, and we're also working on a potential virtual solution in the event that it's not safe to congregate (as it is unsafe to do so now, 20 March).  In short, we're working on an alternate plan, potentially multiple alternate plans.  We'll have more plans as the situation unfolds.

Until then, please take care of each other, check in, safely, with your neighbors, drink lots of water, and check if your favorite restaurant will do a curbside pickup!
