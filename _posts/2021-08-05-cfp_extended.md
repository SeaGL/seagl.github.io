Need a little more time to get your proposal together for SeaGL 2021?
Good news!
We've *extended the submission deadline to August 19*.
This gives you two more weeks to submit a talk proposal about free software, security, tech culture, community, and more!
If you need some ideas, check out our [suggested topic categories](https://seagl.org/news/2021/06/24/cfp.html#talk-topicslabels).

If you have questions about the [Call for Proposals](https://seagl.org/news/2021/06/24/cfp) process or want feedback on your talk proposal, we have one more [office hours](https://seagl.org/news/2021/07/30/office_hours.html) session.
Join us in chat or on video at [seagl.org/meet](https://seagl.org/meet) at 3:00 PM Pacific on Saturday, August 7.
If you can't make the office hours, email your questions to [cfp-help@seagl.org](mailto:cfp-help@seagl.org) any time.

When you're ready to submit, our [CfP portal](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2021#callforpapers) is ready for you!
