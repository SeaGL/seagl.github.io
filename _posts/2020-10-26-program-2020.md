The schedule is filled with lots of great talks from very talented speakers and spans November 13-14.

Take some time to browse through the list of talks and start deciding which ones you will be attending.

As a reminder, SeaGL 2020 is completely [virtual](https://seagl.org/news/2020/05/05/virtualconf-2020.html).

SeaGL is also completely free as in tea with no registration required, so everyone is welcome to attend.
