It's time to start announcing our four brilliant keynoters for 2018, starting with Molly de Blanc!

Molly is Campaigns Manager for the Free Software Foundation, where she organizes people around free software issues, researches and writes on new and longstanding software issues, and draws connections between current events and user freedoms.

As an independent researcher, Molly has explored how people communicate in and around free software communities and the effects on language from policies such as codes of conduct. Her interests include the demographics of communities and the way labor is divided among participants based on open contribution. Molly works with the Debian project's Outreach team, facilitating Debian participation in the Google Summer of Code and Outreachy mentorship projects. She serves on the board of directors of the Open Source Initiative.

Prior to joining the FSF, Molly worked in free and open education including the publishing team at MITOpenCourseWare and as community coordinator of the Open edX Project. She was previously affiliated with One Laptop Per Child and the Youth and Media Group at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School.

In her spare time, Molly enjoys biking, climbing, cooking, and playing guitar and bassoon in a band that produces freely licensed music.

Stay tuned for our second keynote announcement tomorrow!
