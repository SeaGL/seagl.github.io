We know that all of the all of you who submitted presentation proposals are waiting
on the edges of your seats to know if you've been selected.  Rest assured that we
have ranked all 70 submissions and we will be notifying the selected speakers in
the next few days.

The reason for the delay is that we have so many great proposals that we're trying
to add extra rooms to the conference so we can have twice as many presentations.
Depending on availability, this could mean over 50 presentations, plus our great
keynote speaker and a block of time set aside for lightning talks.

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions, either by
emailing {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }}
or visting us on IRC on
[Freenode]({{ site.custom.url.irc.network }}) in
[#seagl]({{ site.custom.url.irc.webchat }}).
