As we enter the final months of our planning season, in these tumultuous times, we wanted to take a moment to look inward. In doing so, we have refined both our [Code of Conduct] and [Mission Statement]. Below you will find some of the reasoning behind these changes. Rest assured, the conference organizers have had no falling outs or great shifts of opinion. Our intent here is to be as open and candid as possible.

SeaGL is committed to accessibility, inclusivity, and diversity. Our programming committee follows and makes public a [Code of Practice]. We are committed to supporting the [Black Lives Matter] movement and other social causes that align with our ethos. Beyond words, we are continually lowering barriers to participation by [offering childcare and lunch](https://seagl.org/news/2018/10/04/Free_Childcare_Free_Lunch.html), [reaching out directly to underserved communities](???), and most recently, [coordinating real-time transcription of presentations](???).

However, things do not always go as smoothly as intended, and when issues arise we are committed to trying our best. We enforce a strict [Code of Conduct], making decisions collectively after gathering the necessary details. To respect the privacy of those involved and insulate any legal concerns, SeaGL's policy is to not make public statements about individual cases. While not perfect, we take specific allegations very seriously and follow up as soon as they are brought up.

All that said, the Seattle GNU/Linux conference is a big and little F free grassroots technical event organized by volunteers. It is difficult to express how much we appreciate all of those who have participated in bringing SeaGL into its 8th year. We wouldn't be here without the community that has supported us along the way and we are committed to supporting it!

If there are any questions regarding our conference or the commitments we make to our community, please reach out to info@seagl.org. If there is a need for further communication regarding the Code of Conduct, please use coc@seagl.org.


Thank you so very much,  
SeaGL Staff
