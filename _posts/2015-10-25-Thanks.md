As we wrap up our third annual conference, we thank all of our speakers,
sponsors, volunteers, exhibitors, and attendees! Each year we see greater
community participation and record attendance numbers.

We're also grateful to everyone who either invited friends to SeaGL or
spread the word through social media. Word of mouth is absolutely critical to
the success of our conference.

Special thanks goes to the staff at [500 East](http://www.500eastsh.com/),
who hosted our keynote speeches and after-party.
