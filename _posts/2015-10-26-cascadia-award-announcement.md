The Cascadia Community Builder Award recognizes a person who has made an
outstanding contribution to the free software movement in the Cascadia region.
The 2015 inaugural winner is Michael Dexter.

The award was given for the first time on Saturday, October 24th at the Seattle
GNU/Linux conference and is expected to remain a feature of the local event. 
Dexter was chosen because his work with the Portland Linux/Unix Group and the
BSD community exemplified the type of unsung community-building work that is so 
critical to the growth of the free software movement. 

Michael has used BSD Unix systems since January of 1991 and provides BSD and
ZFS support at Gainframe. He has supported BSD Unix with download mirrors,
events, and projects for over a decade and is best known for his virtualization
work. His advice for free software community activists is, "Trust your
instincts, ask lots of questions, and ignore the discouragement that will come
from every side."

Michael was nominated by someone who got to know him through his tireless work
with the Portland Linux User Group. The nomination reads, "Michael has
organized over one hundred speakers for our two monthly meetings, including
Linus Torvalds, Bradley Kuhn, and Ward Cunningham." Dexter received an engraved
multi-tool, made by the Oregon-based Leatherman company, that includes both a
bottle opener and a wire stripper -- critical tools for every free software
community organizer. Michael will also be invited to participate in choosing
the recipient of future Cascadia Community Builder awards.

Nominations for the 2016 honoree will open next summer.
