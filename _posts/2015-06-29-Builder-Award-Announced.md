We are pleased to announce that we will be giving the out the first Cascadia Community Builder Award at SeaGL this year!

This is a new award for a person who has made an outstanding contribution to the free software movement in Washington, Oregon, British Columbia and Idaho. This award will be given to someone for their work to build the free software community over the last one to three years. The winner of this award will be someone who has have applied deep commitment and creativity to growing and broadening the community.  The award is designed to recognize work in software projects, non-profit organizations, outreach and education, hackerspace, user groups or any activity that promotes the adoption and appreciation of free software to new and larger groups of people. The awards committee is especially interested in individuals who have successfully reached out to traditionally under-represented groups, even if that is not the primary goal.
