Due to some logistical issues, we've had to move this year's keynote speeches
off-site from Seattle Central College.

The keynotes will take place at [500 East](http://www.500eastsh.com/), "a
social house" just a short walk from the school. Here's the address:

500 E Pine St, Seattle, WA 98122

Here's the Saturday afternoon schedule:
