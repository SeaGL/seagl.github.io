We have a schedule! After a lot of hard work we have posted our schedule to
lanyrd. We are once again using this site to manage our schedule and session
info. Head on over to [our event page](http://lanyrd.com/2014/seagl/) to have
a look and mark your calendars!

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions, either by
emailing {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }}
or visting us on IRC on
[Freenode]({{ site.custom.url.irc.network }}) in
[#seagl]({{ site.custom.url.irc.webchat }}).
