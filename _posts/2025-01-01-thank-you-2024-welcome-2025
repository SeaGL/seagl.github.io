As we look back to SeaGL 2024, we want to send a heart-felt  thank you to our speakers, attendees, sponsors, and volunteers for making our 12th year running SeaGL such a success 🎉!  We hope you had an opportunity to listen to some great talks and chat with other open minded folks. Here's to continuing to ruffle some feathers and keep supporting a more free technological world in 2025!  

Speaking of 2025, we have confirmed a date to share with you all! Please mark your calendars for SeaGL in November 8th and 9th at the University of Washington in rainy and proud of it, Seattle.  Our A/V & Devops team will keep up the amazing work delivering the conference to you remotely and publishing videos on our [archive](/archive). 

If you have opinions and would like to shape SeaGL for the better, we would love to have you join us!  Please consider becoming a [volunteer](/volunteer)!

Cheers ✨ to contributing to such a creative and inclusive community, looking forward celebrating the spooky **thirteenth** event with you at the beginning of November this year!
