As we look back on SeaGL 2024, we want to send a heart-felt thank you to the speakers, attendees, sponsors, and volunteers for making our 12th SeaGL such a success ðŸŽ‰! We hope you had an opportunity to listen to some great talks and chat with other open minded folks. Here's to continuing to ruffle some feathers and supporting a more free technological world in 2025!

Speaking of 2025, we have confirmed our dates and want to share them with you all! Please mark your calendars for SeaGL on **November 7th and 8th**. We are returning to the University of Washington for a third year in rainy, and proud of it, Seattle. And if you're refraining from migration, we plan to keep you connected by live streaming our gathering as in past few years.

We also wanted to let you know that the A/V & DevOps team members are working hard to publish recordings on our [archive](/archive) and appreciate your patience. If you have opinions and would like to shape SeaGL for the better, we would love to have you join us! Please consider becoming a [volunteer](/volunteer)!

Cheers âœ¨ to all who have contributed to such a creative and inclusive community! We are looking forward celebrating the spooky **thirteenth** event with you at the beginning of November this year!
