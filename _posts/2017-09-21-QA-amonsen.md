Adam Monsen gives his talk titled, "Automatic Chicken Door HOWTO (No it will not hurt a chicken)" on [Friday afternoon](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2017/program/proposals/290).

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?

A: I'm a Seattle-native [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) fanatic and VP of Engineering at [C-SATS](https://www.csats.com/). I co-founded and help organize SeaGL. My blog is at <https://adammonsen.com/>.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?

A: Inspiration to do your own fun, rewarding hardware project. Knowledge of which parts will be easy and which parts will be challenging. This is my first Raspberry Pi project.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

A: I've been to every SeaGL so far. I heart heart heart SeaGL because we focus on inclusion and education of _everyone_ about FLOSS.

Q: Would I rather have a frontal lobotomy or a bottle in front of me?

A: What the heck... I guess I'd go for the bottle. Wait, for you, or me? And bottle of what?
