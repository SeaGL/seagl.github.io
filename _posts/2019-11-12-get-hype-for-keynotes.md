SeaGL 2019 is in four days!  So let's give a quick wrapup on those keynotes!

On the first day of SeaGL 2019, Friday 15 November 2019, we have two AMAZING keynotes!  Come on in to the Theater starting at 9am for the Friday conference kickoff.  We'll get started with announcements and welcome at 9:15, then begin with our first keynote, Lisha Sterling, going at 9:30am.

Lisha's keynote is titled *The Cost Of Freedom* and she'll be sharing lessons of proprietary versus non-proprietary software, power structures, and grassroots organizing.  Lisha's pronouns are she/her.

Next up we have Abigail Cabunoc Mayes at 10am!  Abby comes to us from Mozilla and shepherding hundreds of open source projects, and she'll be talking about the principles of open leadership and intentional openness in the design of future projects.  Her talk is called *Open by Design: Learning to Lead Openly*.  Abby's pronouns are she/her.

Saturday we'll be off to a strong start with Benjamin Mako Hill, a.k.a. just "Mako", with *How markets coopted free softwareâ€™s most powerful weapon*, a discussion of commons-based peer production projects and the impact of the private sector monetizing these, and what it means for those of us committed to working in commons. Mako's pronouns are he/him.

Finally, on Saturday we are honored to present Sage Sharp.  Sage has had an amazing career in countless facets of open source, and is here to share their talk, *Countering Impostor Syndrome Culture*, discussing how we can support one another and change our culture that creates and perpetuates impostor syndrome.  Sage's pronouns are they/them.
