Heidi Waterhouse gives her talk titled, "Verbose mode: an exploration of programming languages and craft" on [Friday afternoon.](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2017/program/proposals/347)

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?

A: I've been in technology for a long time, longer than I've been knitting and sewing my own clothes, but I'm always fascinated by understanding the implicit knowledge we expect people to have. Sometimes that manifests as "From root" and sometimes as "CO 200 sts". I spent almost all of my career as a technical writer, but now I'm trying a new thing as a developer advocate. It's interesting being able to pull culture and change, instead of starting everything off trying to persuade people to listen to me.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?

A:  I think a lot of people think of crafting as soft and creative, a long way from the blinking cursor of code and administration. I want to point out that learning new things follows many of the same patterns, and that there is nothing magical about learning technology. I am also planning pictures of adorable sheep.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

A: This is the first time I get to go! I was supposed to come last year, but I hurt myself the week before I was supposed to fly out, so you got to hear from @kopasetic instead! Pro-tip: if you are falling in your garage, the bikes will not save your nor break your fall.

Q: What's your favorite sculpture in the Olympic Sculpture Park?

A: Wake, by Richard Serra. I was working in downtown Seattle when the park opened, and I love this piece for its vastness and rust and ambiguity.
