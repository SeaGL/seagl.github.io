We are very pleased to announce our 2024 Seattle GNU/Linux conference keynote speakers:

## Christopher Neugebauer

Australian developer, speaker, and serial community conference organizer, who presently lives in the United States.

He serves as a Director of the Python Software Foundation, and is co-organizer of the acclaimed North Bay Python conference, a boutique one-track conference run in unusual venues — include an old vaudeville theater, and more recently a barn on a farm — in Petaluma, California.

Christopher is also a contributor on the open source Pants build system, helping make Python’s testing, correctness, and style tools accessible and fast for developers, no matter how big their codebase.

## Duane O'Brien

Duane is the Director of Collaborative Engineering at Capital One. His organization focuses on developing internal and external collaborative development practices through open source and InnerSource. He is the creator of the [FOSS Contributor Fund framework](https://github.com/indeedeng/FOSS-Contributor-Fund), and loves helping organizations get involved in funding and sustaining their open source dependencies. Duane is a force of chaotic good using his high stats in intelligence and charisma to advocate for the open source community. If you encounter him in forested areas, he will share his fire, drink, and philosophy.

## Aaron Wolf

First time keynote speaker, Aaron is a community music teacher, co-founder of [Snowdrift.coop](https://snowdrift.coop/) (a long-struggling and principled platform working to solve economic coordination dilemmas around FLO public goods), and an activist and volunteer in many other areas. Originally from Ann Arbor, MI; he now lives in Oregon City with his wife, dog, and two kids.

## Rachel Kelly

Rachel is a long-time nerd and denizen of the internet, learning to form community without social media!  A proud career-switcher, she has worked for tech companies small and large since 2014 and has been happily plugging away at Fastly for the last several years as an SRE on the Certificate Authority project.  A staunch advocate of community and locality, Rachel now uses skills learned from many years of co-organizing Portland's PyLadies chapter and participating in many community-oriented technology user groups toward something completely different.  She and her partner live in Portland, OR, going to too many Burning Man events (not possible) and training for simply too many races of all kinds (also not possible).
