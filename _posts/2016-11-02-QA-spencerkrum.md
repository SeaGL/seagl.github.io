Spencer gives his talk titled, "OpenStack for Humans" on [Saturday afternoon.](https://osem.seagl.org/conference/seagl2016/program/proposal/110)

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?

A: My name is Spencer Krum. I've been doing Open Source things in the Pacific NW for the past several years. I work at IBM on the OpenStack project, making Open Source cloud software.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?

A: This talk is going to introduce OpenStack to people who want to know what it is, where it comes from, and what to do with it. OpenStack has been going for 5 years and there has been a lot of hype. I'm hoping to educate the audience on some simple use cases and answer some common questions. If you last checked in on OpenStack a few years ago, what you learn might surprise you!

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

A: This will be my third SeaGL conference. Ever year I make sure to attend this event. It is such a good mix of community members, we are so privileged in the PacNW to have so many awesome people. You never know which OSI board member is sitting next to you in a session!

Q: What small thing makes SeaGL great?

A: I really enjoy the impromptu GPG keysigning party that always pops up. It's always a small hoot.
