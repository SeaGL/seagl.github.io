Thanks to all who have submitted to our Call for Proposals so far!

This year, as we return to in-person activities, we experimented with moving up the selection period.
However, due to delays in advertising this change and the release of our [Health and Safety Policy](/health_and_safety_policy), we've decided to extend the CfP.

Submissions will now be accepted until **Friday, June 30 at 11:59 PT**! So head to [our talk submission portal, OSEM](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2023) and submit today!

Hopefully this will give previous speakers enough time to put something in and lead to a more diverse selection of content for our reviewers to sift through.

Need some suggestions on what to submit? Check our our blog post outlining [this year's categories](/news/2023/03/08/CFP-Details) and the initial [Call for Proposals](/news/2023/03/08/CFP-Open) post.

Have any questions about your submission or want to volunteer with the conference? You can contact us via email at {{ site.custom.a.email.program }}, [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@SeaGL), or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#general:seagl.org).

Looking forward to seeing many of you this fall in Seattle or virtually world-wide!
