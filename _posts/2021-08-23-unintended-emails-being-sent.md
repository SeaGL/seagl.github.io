Hello SeaGL community,

Some of you might be getting multiple emails from us. We want to apologize for the unintended mailings. Some changes were made to past conference schedules as part of a general clean up. We were working on an archive page that was disconnected from OSEM, our conference software. Unfortunately, there were no notifications from OSEM that emails were being sent to the community.

We are currently working on a shim to stop any emails from going ount until all updates are done. Thank you so much for your patience. You can reach out to us on our usual communication channels.
