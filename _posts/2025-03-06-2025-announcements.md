As we shake off the winter chill and begin organizing this year's conference, we wanted to share some things with the community.


## New Theme

We're excited to announce the theme for the 13th annual SeaGL: **freedom is in the cards**


## Fliers Fly

The newest SeaGL handbill design has dropped and can be found [here](/fliers/2025/)! You're welcome and encouraged to share it around, whether in the printed or posted form. And keep an eye out at [SCaLE (the Southern California Linux Expo)](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/), hosted this weekend in Pasadena, for the first in-person batch!


## Newest Social Stand

It has been great to see so many people leaving walled garden social media networks lately! While we will continue to cross-post in an effort to reach those who are left, we've added a new network to our quiver: {{ site.custom.a.social.bluesky}}

This network has grown quite a bit with the recent migration. It is built on top of the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/), an open source, open standard.

Our [website](https://seagl.org) will still be the primary place to look for all things SeaGL related, but we hope to keep the various social media profiles up-to-date. Please follow us and share what you see!


## Keynote Nominations

One of the *many things* that sets SeaGL apart from other conferences is that the community helps us select our keynote speakers. In prior years we've asked for suggestions over a two-week period, but moving forward we'll keep [the form](/keynote_suggestions) open year-round.

Nominees need not have prior keynote experience; we are interested in both new and veteran presenters. In fact, [since 2018](/news/2018/04/30/keynote_selection_process), we've been reserving half of our keynote slots to amplify the voices of speakers who may be presenting on the main stage for the first time.

While you are welcome to nominate yourself, we encourage you to take some time to think about people you have seen present, who you think have an important message to share. If they have been doing exciting work in the Free / Libre / Open (FLO) community, we want to know about them!

We challenge you to think about people who:

- Have done work to empower others and challenge social norms
- You go out of your way to read all of their Open Source posts on social media
- Might only have a small following, but are doing amazing work in their own little corner
- Are always tinkering with new and exciting projects that inspire others to try new things
- Are slowly, but steadily, working to make the FLO community and world a better place, for everyone

Submissions are anonymous and the form is open, so [nominate someone today](/keynote_suggestions)!


## Volunteering

As always, we want to remind folks that SeaGL is an all-volunteer effort. Visit the [get involved](/get_involved) page for more details about how you can help!
