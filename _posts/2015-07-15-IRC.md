This year we're hosting live help sessions for potential speakers on our IRC
channel on Freenode. If you'd like to know of your idea is a good fit
for our conference, or just want help finessing a few sentences in your
proposal, please join our channel on the dates below:

Thursday, July 16, 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. PDT
Sunday, July 26th, 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. PDT

[Freenode]({{ site.custom.url.irc.network }}) channel:
[#seagl]({{ site.custom.url.irc.webchat }})

Of course, if you can't make our live help sessions, we're always available by
email at {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }} and many of the conference
organizers can be found at random times hanging out in the IRC channel.
