John Dulaney gives his talk titled, "Naval Gunnery Fire Control in WWI" on [Friday morning.](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2016/program/proposal/119)

Q: Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?

A: My name is John Dulaney.  I am a contributor to the Dreadnought Project, and
have long had an interest in maritime history, and especially in World War One
era naval technology.  The Dreadnought Project aims to provide open access to
scholarly naval research.

Q: Without tipping your hand on the actual talk, can you give us an idea of what we might expect?

A: The talk will cover the problem of hitting a tiny, moving target on the horizon
from a platform that itself is moving in three dimensions using the technology
available 100 years ago.

Q: Is this your first visit to SeaGL? If so, what are your expectations? If not, can you give us your impressions of the event?

A: This will be my first SEAGL.  I expect it to be an interesting conference judging from what I know of the organizers.

Q: Why do you make historical research freely available?

A: I believe that our history should be available, not just gratis, but easily and freely accessible.
