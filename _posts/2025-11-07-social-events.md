Welcome to the **thirteenth year** of our free—_as in freedom and tea_—grassroots technical summit!

Below are a variety of details regarding how to attend, what’s on the schedule, and where you can help. Please take a moment to read and share!

## How to Attend

You can join us [in-person](/attend#attend-in-person) on the University of Washington campus at the Husky Union Building (known as the HUB). Those not in Seattle, or otherwise occupied, are encouraged to [participate remotely](/attend#attend-remotely) via Matrix.

As always, both options are **free/gratis** and **registration is optional**—just show up! However, this year we are providing an option to [register](/register) without identifying yourself, which helps us estimate attendance.

Do note that all staff, presenters, and attendees of SeaGL are expected to obey the [Code of Conduct](/code_of_conduct) not only at SeaGL but also in all SeaGL-associated spaces including but not limited to associated social events and virtual channels.

In-person attendees are also expected to obey the [Health and Safety Policy](health_and_safety_policy) for the duration of the conference. This includes requiring masks inside _some but not all_ presentation rooms and encouraging them in other areas. If you don’t have your own we are providing them gratis.

## Schedule

Each day of SeaGL will be packed full, with doors opening at **8am Pacific Time (PT) (16:00 UTC)**. There will be _two keynote presentation_ per day at **9am PT (17:00 UTC)**, followed by _over 40 presentations_ until **6pm PT (02:00 UTC)**.

For those attending in-person, on Friday Ada’s will be hosting an on-site _Tech Book Sale_ running from **1:30pm to 4:00pm PT**. On Saturday Resist Tech Monopolies will be hosting a _DiscoTech_ from **1pm to 4:30pm PT** where you can bring your devices and discover surviellance-free FLOSS tech alternatives. Additionally, each afternoon the Tea Tavern will host a tea break (_TeaGL_) at **3:30pm PT** in the Expo Hall.

Friday night’s social will be at [Ada's Technical Books & Cafe](https://adasbooks.com/) beginning at **6:30pm PT** and a cash bar will be available. There will be a _live jazz band_ starting at **7:30pm PT**, with _pizza_ arriving shortly thereafter. The evening will end with a _fundraiser auction_ for [Seattle Community Network](https://fundraiser.seattlecn.org/).

Saturday night’s social will begin with an hour long _security mixer and keysigning party_ at **6:00pm PT**, transitioning to [Big Time Brewery & Alehouse](https://www.bigtimebrewery.com/) which is walking distance from the event at **7:00pm PT**.

Additional detail can be found in the [schedule](/schedule).

_Please note_, both of the evening socials have a capacity of approximately **80 people**. If you find it too crowded, check-out the [Hallway Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#seagl2025-hallway:seattlematrix.org) to connect with other attendees who may be flocking to nearby venues.

## Social Media

We encourage everyone to get together, chat, and just generally share their SeaGL experiences. After all, people are the best part of Free Software.

If you share anything on your social network of choice, please use the `#SeaGL2025` hashtag so everyone can follow along. You can also follow us on {{ custom.a.social.mastodon }} or {{ custom.a.social.bluesky }}  for announcements and updates.

## Volunteering

Don’t forget, SeaGL is a 100% volunteer run conference and we are always looking for more help! If you are interested in helping out during the event, please fill out our [volunteer form](/volunteer).

Here are some of the at-event positions we’re looking for more help with:

- **Room Monitors:** introduce speakers (with their permission), perform room head counts, make sure speakers have everything they need, and ensure sessions run smoothly and finish on time.
- **Sign-Wranglers:** post up and take down signs in and around venue.
- **Refreshment Aides:** help with the set up, tear down, and clean up of coffee and tea breaks.
- **Information Attendants:** register attendees (if they want), check-in speakers and exhibitors, hand out programs, and provide directions and answers to questions.
- **Virtual Hosts:** keep an eye on the Matrix channels, identify content in need of moderation, reach out to in-person staff as needed.

We are also excited to welcome year-round volunteers who would like to continue helping out after the conference. If you’re interested in joining the flock, please reach out via [Matrix or email](/get_involved#volunteer-for-seagl).
