**Take a moment to thank someone for their work**

We know there's a lot going on right now. We believe that building strong local communities is really important work that doesn't get a lot of the splashy credit it deserves. Please help us recognize someone by nominating them for the Cascadia Community Builder Award by the end of the day Wednesday, August 23rd.

To nominate someone, please send us a quick email (award@seagl.org) with the nominee's name in the subject line. 

* Name and email address of the nominee (if you have it)
* A sentence or two about why you think they deserve this award
* Projects or organizations they serve through (links are very helpful!)

Please only nominate people who are doing their free software work in the [Casacadia region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_(bioregion)) and who are currently living. Thanks in advance for helping us honor a great community builder!

The award will be presented in October at SeaGL and announced on [Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/)

**PS Got a suggestion for a hashtag for the award? Tweet at us at @seagl and let us know!**
