Our schedule is up! [Take a look!](https://osem.seagl.org/conference/seagl2015/schedule) The first day is visible first, but if you change the tab at the top, you'll see the second day. 

The schedule doesn't include our very exciting keynotes yet. Shauna Gordon-McKeon will speak on Saturday morning from 9:30 - 10:30am about her work with brand new contributors to free software. At the end of the day on Saturday, Richard M. Stallman will speak at 2:30pm about Free Software and Your Freedom. Expect news about the expo floor, post-conference party and our community partners soon!

If you are just marking your calendar now, we'll be at Seattle Central College again and the conference will be held on Friday October 23rd and Saturday October 24th,
2015. Booth space is definitely filling up, so now's the time to drop us a line by emailing {{ site.custom.a.email.sponsor }} about your company or group. Our sponsor prospectus is [right here.](http://seagl.org/sponsors/SeaGL_Exhibitor_Sponsor_Prospectus_2015.pdf) We'd love to hear from you!
