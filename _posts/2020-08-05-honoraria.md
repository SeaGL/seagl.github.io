SeaGL has previously shared our commitment to supporting [Black Lives Matter](https://seagl.org/news/2020/06/12/black-lives-matter.html). We feel it is important to endorse an approach of equity in our communities, in order to offer the support that everyone needs to be able to participate.

That is why we are excited to be able to offer an honorarium, a small amount of money as a thank-you for offering your time and knowledge, for speakers who are Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC)! The hope is that by doing this, SeaGL can continue to support our community and further our shared value of seeking out unreached/underrepresented/underserved communities and advocate for them, and their talks.  This is but one of many values we have committed to in our [Program Committee Code of Practice](https://seagl.org/news/2020/07/13/code_of_practice.html).

We have not yet determined an exact dollar amount. These honoraria will only be available to US-based speakers as the logistics of granting funds outside our own country is a larger challenge than our volunteer organizers can currently take on. That being said, we absolutely still encourage everyone, regardless of location, to submit talks and to attend the conference virtually!

If you are interested in submitting a talk, more details can be found on our recent [Call for Proposals](https://seagl.org/news/2020/07/14/CFP-open.html) for details. You may also join us every Wednesday at 12pm Pacific Time (UTC-7) for CFP office hours in #SeaGL on the freenode.net IRC network.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at <honorarium@seagl.org>.

Thank you,
SeaGL Staff
