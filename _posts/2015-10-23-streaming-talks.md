Speakers:

If Google Hangouts works on your laptop and you want to livestream talks to the
SeaGL YouTube channel (they'll also be automatically recorded by this
process), here are the directions!

1) Go to `plus.google.com` and log in with the account credentials provided by
an organizer.

2) Click the round avatar in the upper right, and select SeaGL from the list.

4) In the upper left, click the "google+ page" button then select "hangouts"
from the menu which drops down.

5) On the hangouts page, click "hangouts on air" (the middle link in the bar
at the top). Then click the big yellow "create a hangout on air" button.

7) Click the big blue "Start" button.

8) When it tells you to invite guests, click "skip".

9) Point your webcam at yourself and click the big green "start broadcast"
button at the bottom. Optionally, before you start the broadcast, use the
icons on the left of the hangout to share your screen.
