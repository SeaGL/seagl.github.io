Our Call for Participation opens soon!

We're currently testing our CFP system. After we do a little more tweaking,
the CFP will officially open.

Like years past, we welcome presentations on diverse topics and speakers from
diverse backgrounds. If you have something interesting to say about GNU/Linux,
or free and open source software, we want to hear from you!

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions, either by
emailing {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }},
or visting us on IRC on
[Freenode]({{ site.custom.url.irc.network }}) in
[#seagl]({{ site.custom.url.irc.webchat }}).
