## About

SeaGL (_the Seattle GNU/Linux conference_) is a free—as in freedom and
tea—grassroots technical summit dedicated to spreading awareness and
knowledge about free / libre / open source software, hardware, and culture.

SeaGL strives to be welcoming, enjoyable, and informative for professional
technologists, newcomers, enthusiasts, and all other users of free software,
regardless of their background knowledge; providing a space to bridge these
experiences and strengthen the free software movement through mentorship,
collaboration, and community.

SeaGL's first year was 2013.
