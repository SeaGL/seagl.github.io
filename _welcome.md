## About

The _Seattle GNU/Linux conference (SeaGL)_ is a grassroots technical conference
dedicated to spreading awareness and knowledge about the GNU/Linux community and
free / libre / open source software and ​hardware.

Our goal for SeaGL is to produce an event which is as enjoyable and informative
for those who spend their days maintaining hundreds of servers as it is for a
student who has only just started exploring technology options.

SeaGL's first year was 2013.
