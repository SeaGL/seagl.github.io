The high-tech industry has revolutionized healthcare, ushering in an amazing new era of medicine, but both providers and patients have struggled to keep up with changes in how we track healthcare data. Widespread digitization of medical records has the promise to be a step forward in the advancement of treatment, but there are several pitfalls that we must avoid to ensure that patients retain control over personal data, are empowered to use open formats, and can access data using FOSS tools.

- How much do you know about Electronic Health Records (EHR/EMR)?
- Do you have a local digital copy of your family's medical records?
- How confident are you that your doctors _can_ and _will_ keep your personal information private and secure?

This talk will provide an introduction to EHR systems, healthcare apps, and both open & closed formats for medical data. We'll discuss legal aspects of medical data, HIPAA, genetic rights, and suggest ways to increase privacy, reduce personal risk, and retain greater control over _who_ gets to see _which_ of your records (and _when_!)
