### Intended Audience
Unix hackers, sysadmins, and developers; especially those skeptical of the JVM and node.js. Anyone interested in functional programming, lisps, or data oriented programming.

### Audience Takeaways
- Basic understanding of Clojure and functional programming
- Appreciation of sympathetic philosphies between Unix and Clojure
- Introduction to scripting with Clojurescript

### Motivation
Clojure is a modern functional, expressive, and data-oriented lisp. However it runs atop the JVM, CLR, and Javascript runtimes. Sometimes seen as bloated, slow, and "something we have to install for developers", this talk aims to show that not only is Clojure(script) fun, performant, and pragmatic, but it also has a lot in common with Unix and can be a useful tool for scripting, server-side devlepment, UI work, and more!

### Outline
#### Intro to Clojure
- Intro and motivation
- Brief history of Lisp

#### Comparisons to Unix

- Pipelines and unix philosophy

#### Scripting with Clojurescript
- Intro to Clojurescript
- Bootstrapped Clojurescript and Planck/Lumo
- Script Examples

#### Beyond Scripting

- Electron
- Server
- React Native

#### Conclusion and References
