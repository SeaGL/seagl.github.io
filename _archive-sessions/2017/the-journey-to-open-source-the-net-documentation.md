Is it possible to build an open source community around docs?
Microsoft, and more specifically the .NET team, have completely embraced open source for all things .NET! Not just the products and tools, but also its documentation.

In this presentation, attendees will learn about the journey to open source the .NET documentation, including its API reference. You’ll learn how to apply the lessons we’ve learned building a community around a product and its documentation. You’ll become more involved with your customer base, delighting them with your efforts.
