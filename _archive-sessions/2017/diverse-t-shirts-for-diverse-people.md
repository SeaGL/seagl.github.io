Did you know that most people are not the same as most other people? I know, it surprised me too.

It turns out, that the differences that people share also affect the sort of clothing that fits them. Different people have different shapes. Different people like different colours.

T-shirt manufacturers, however, aren't always great at reflecting this diversity. Fewer colours are available in "women's cuts" than in "men's cuts". The colours available in larger sizes are not the colours available in smaller sizes. Some women do not fit into the same sorts of fitted t-shirt as other women. Not all men want "men's cut" shirts.

People in tech love t-shirts, and they can be a great way to get people to do free advertising for you. But for that to work, you need people to actually want to wear your shirt.

Over the last few years, the conferences that I've run have started working on ways to make our attendees enjoy their conference t-shirts more, with excellent results. I'd like to share these strategies with you so that we can fit more people into more excellent t-shirts.
