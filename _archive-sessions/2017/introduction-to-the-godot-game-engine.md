Ever wanted to learn how to build your own game? There's never been a better time to start. While most of the industry is focused on proprietary engines, there are also a number of free software game engines that don't get nearly as much press.

This talk will introduce you to Godot, a capable and fully-featured game engine, 100% free and open source, under active development, with excellent support for the Linux platform. I will introduce you to the game engine's editor, scripting language, and I will guide you through the engine's most important concepts (and around some of its most common pitfalls). Even if you've never used a game engine before, at the end of this talk you'll be armed with enough basic knowledge to write your first game.
