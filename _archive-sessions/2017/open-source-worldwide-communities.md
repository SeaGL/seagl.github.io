In this talk I'll tell you my story about contributing to an Open Source community from abroad. Nowadays, communities have a lot of people from all around the world. What's their perspective? How do you deal with timezones? How do you get involved and get others from around the world involved? And how does culture in each area affect the community? Learn this and much more.
