  biography: Julia is not your average engineer. She started with networking. Over
    time slowly drifted through systems engineering in to the DevOps movement. She
    currently contributes to OpenStack, and mainly focuses on the use of Bare Metal
    servers in cloud computing, since besides... how else do you get a cloud?

A little over two years ago, I was told in a Vancouver conference center meeting room, "Two others have tried to propose that feature, but they have both failed". I knew it was the right path to take. I knew people in the room and the larger community wanted to go in that direction. The question was how?

In this this talk, I'll cover my experience building consensus on design, setting expectations across the community, and rallying people together to reach critical mass to land a complex cross project feature in a project such as OpenStack.
