Want to take your shell scripting to the next level? Interested in adding string manipulation and arrays to your arsenal? In shell math?

Shell still has the best system integration for stringing together our favorite command line tools such as ls, grep and sed. Better yet is doing some of that work in the shell without reaching for a forked program, especially inside loops. This presentation will cover intermediate scripting techniques and useful command line tips.

After attending this session, audience members will understand string operators, in shell math, indexed arrays and associative arrays. They will also be familiar with regular expressions, globbing and differences between the two. Finally, attendees will be familiar with useful builtin variables.
