  biography: I got my first personal computer in 1969.  From there, I have fascinated
    by ones and zeros, although I don't know why because if you've seen one one, you've
    seen them all and the zeroes are nothing to look at, either.  I've worked at Boeing,
    Mathsoft, the UW, Real Networks, F5 Networks, Google, Sweetlabs, Impinj, Juniper
    Networks, Amazon, and now at AT&T.

Python 3.6 has a bunch of cool features, but you have to know what they are if you are going to take advantage of them.  My talk is going to focus on what is new and why they are "cool" and you should use them.

I am also going to discuss the decision criteria you should use when making the decision about what which version to use when implementing your python software projects.
