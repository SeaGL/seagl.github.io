While sharing of and collaborating on software has been around as long as there's been code, the open source concept and movement only came into being in the late 1990s. There are many who remember a time before open source. Of those, most helped to shape the philosophy, laws, governance, and policies which are the foundation of the free and open source movement we enjoy today.

But what happens when these people decide to retire? Who will carry the baton and lead the movement?

Thankfully these people are still with us, helping to craft and lead FOSS, but there are very few younger individuals among their ranks. As we look at the next horizon for FOSS, we must consider who will take us there. While we have these founders in our midst, we must take the time to do succession planning for free and open source leadership.

This talk will cover:

* Succession planning: what it is & why we need it
* What new leaders must know & learn
* Steps we can take to develop the FOSS leaders of the future
