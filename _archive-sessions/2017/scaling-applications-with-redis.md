Using Redis for

- Caching
- As queue for running background jobs
- Storing rapidly changing data

I will be sharing real world examples of practical solutions to scale
applications.  It will be intermediate to advanced level talk.  It is best to
have some Redis experience and understanding of key/value data stores, caching
and queues.  Or exposure to alternative technologies such as Memcache or
RabbitMQ.
