FLOSS community leaders and participants seeking to promote diversity and inclusion within their community must contend with the collective inertia of the status quo.  How much should committed communities be prepared to invest in order to overcome this inertia? And, how can they measure and justify their success?

My presentation will examine the social and financial costs FLOSS communities have incurred when promoting diversity and inclusion, and the return on those investments.  I will focus on the experiences of a particular FLOSS project, and discuss their challenges and successes.
