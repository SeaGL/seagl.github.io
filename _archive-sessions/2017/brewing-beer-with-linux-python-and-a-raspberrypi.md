Making beer with open software is a blast! There are a host of open source programs available for driving the hardware required to brew awesome beer. This presentation will include an overview of the most popular brewing software available with special attention paid to the python-based project "CraftBeerPi". There will also be a detailed review of the system Christopher has been brewing beer with, including all-electric kettles and a temperature controlled fermentation chamber.
