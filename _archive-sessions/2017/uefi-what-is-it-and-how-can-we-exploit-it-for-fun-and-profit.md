UEFI carries with it a lot of negative connotations. While it's far from perfect, it's certainly not the overarching evil thing that a lot of us make it out to be. Here we'll discuss the facts and faction surrounding UEFI and the difference between it and other related technologies like Secure Boot, Coreboot, BIOS, and others.

After this we'll take a look at a direct comparison between booting a computer using both UEFI and the Legacy BIOS. And we'll have a look at some of the really neat things the UEFI Environment lets us do, such as playing games without an OS, updating system firmware without DOS, and even writing bootloaders in 300 lines of Python.
