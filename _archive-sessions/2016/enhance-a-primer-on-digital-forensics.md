News today is thick with stories of government agencies trying to find digital evidence of wrongdoing; interrogating mobile phones for evidence, tracing emails to find a stalker or looking at a killer’s search history to discover motives. Digital forensic analysis now plays a pivotal role in both corporate and legal investigations. However, few outside of the industry understand the intricacies involved in a forensic undertaking - the capabilities and limitations of the forensics investigative process, the role of the digital forensic investigator or the extent of the laws governing these actions.

In this session, I will provide an overview of digital forensics. Attendees will learn what digital forensics draws from forensic science, how the law informs what a forensic investigator is ethically able to do and what the incident response process should look like.
