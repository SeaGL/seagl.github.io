Feeling hungry? You’ve came to the right place! As APIs have become increasingly more important and popular in usage in the past few years in web development, it is important to understand the basics of what they are and why to use them. I will be going over the basics: The What’s, Why’s, Where’s, and When’s. You will learn the basics of REST APIs and I will show you how you can use POSTMAN to test making REST API calls. I will use Cisco’s Spark and Tropo as use case examples of working with APIs.
