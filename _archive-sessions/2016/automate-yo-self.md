  biography: John is the VP of Technology for Infinity Interactive, a technology consultancy
    and bespoke software development shop. When he's not madly trying to keep up with
    the pace of change in Javascript development, maintaining Perl modules, or tweaking
    his Emacs config, he likes to play around with new languages like Swift and Rust
    and write about himself in the third person.
