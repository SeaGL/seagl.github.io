The Reproducible Builds project aims to bring us closer to a world
where binary software can be independently verified as the result of
building the provided source code, as a matter of best practices.

Without being able to verify that the software actually used is the
software produced from the source code, this leaves open the possibility of
unintentional or even malicious security vulnerabilities.

The focus will be on common examples of reproducibility issues,
tools to troubleshoot reproducibility issues, and most importantly,
ways to fix these issues.
