Contrary to the popular opinion, Linux Containers is not a new technology -- its development started well before the term itself appeared. The talk goes through the last 15 (or so) years of Linux Containers development, mostly covering the enabling kernel features such as namespaces, cgroups and checkpoint/restore, but also mentioning products such as Docker, OpenVZ, LXC/LXD, and CRIU.
