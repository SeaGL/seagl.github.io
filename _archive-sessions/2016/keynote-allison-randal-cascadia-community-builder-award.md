Title: Free as in Freedom

Description: "And if it comes back to being all alone at the starting gate, so be
it. We hadn't wanted this fuss, these extras. We were calm under an
appearance of turmoil, and so we remain even today, an unwanted
inspiration to those who come immediately after as well as those
who came before, lots of them, stretching back into times of
discussion. I told you so, we can handle it, hand on the stick
shift headed into the billboard labeled Tomorrow, the adventures of
new music, melismas shrouding the past and the passing days."

-- John Ashbery, “Episode” from Planisphere
