I've been asked by other sysadmins "Why are you so happy? You're at work." Sure, there are things that stress me out. There are  definitely parts of my job I truly dislike, but overall, I'm having fun. How did I manage to hold on to that sense of fun when so many admins around me didn't? Well, honestly, I didn't either. I've had to relearn it more than once. I've managed to find the things that work and the things that don't. I'd like to share them with others, and open a discussion about what's worked or isn't working for the group.
Important topics include:
* Compartmentalization - Separating work from outside life.
* Users - Can be frustrating, but also your biggest support. How do you gain their buy in?
* Tools - Deployment, Config Management, and Monitoring keep you sane. Or, at least less insane.
* Networking - A good network of other geeks is very important for information and mental health.
* Stress Management - Lower stress by learning key skills and humor.
