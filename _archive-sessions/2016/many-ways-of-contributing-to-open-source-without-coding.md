When we think of open source contributions, we immediately think of code.  Yes there are many areas where we need contributions and value contributions. Example, documentation, testing, legal advice, marketing etc.  I will showcase non-code ways to contribute to open source and recognize people who are leaders in these areas.  This encourages non-traditional contributors to get involved and use this to develop deeper competency in open source methods.
