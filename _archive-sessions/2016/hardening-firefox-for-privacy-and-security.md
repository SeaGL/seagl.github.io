The Web can be a hostile place, full of deceptive and malicious sites trying to install software on your computer or steal your personal information. However, you have a friend on your side: your user agent (also called your web browser).

This talk will examine some of the hidden or advanced settings and extensions that Firefox offers to users who are concerned about their security and privacy. While we at Mozilla strive to bring these features to all of our users, the reality is that it's sometimes challenging to balance the need for maximum web compatibility and standards compliance with the desire to phase out harmful practices. With a little bit of context on the benefits and risks that some of these features provide, you should be able to make informed decisions and tweak your favorite user agent.
