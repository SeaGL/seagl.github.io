Title: The Art of Personal Failure

Description: Most talks cover a victory in some form. A story of overcoming adversity, solving a complex problem, and finding success. This talk is different. Corey shares three deeply personal stories of failure from his own life-- stories that map to many of our own experiences; in life, in our careers, and our work with free software communities.
