How do you securely provide sensitive information to automated systems without typing in passphrases at 2 in the morning? Bri will discuss the ways he allows headless daemons to access secrets with minimum security impact. Topics will include ssh and gpg agents, encfs partitions, full disk encryption (including remote unlock), hashicorp vault, LastPass, the simple socket secret provider (Open Sourcing today!) and others.
