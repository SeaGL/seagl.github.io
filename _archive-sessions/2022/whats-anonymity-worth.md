What is anonymity worth? What is lost when people who prefer or need to remain anonymous are excluded? How do platforms and communities respond to anonymity seekers? In this talk, I'll share results from a series of ten research projects to understand the reasons people seek anonymity, how and why anonymity-seekers are excluded from many online communities, and the value of leaving space for people to remain anonymous while participating. I'll conclude with an evaluation of the results of community efforts to manage participation from anonymous participants. You'll leave this talk with a series of specific steps you can take individually, in your community, and in your workplace.
