  biography: I've been interested in technology since childhood. My first PC was a
    486 clone that was upgraded many times over. My interest for Linux started with
    Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy Badger), but has since found home with Debian. I'm RHCSA certified
    and enjoy sharing my passion for FOSS with others.
