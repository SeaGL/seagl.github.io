In this talk, I will discuss the pros and cons of self-hosting web apps (such as Nextcloud, Airsonic, calibre-web) and how to simplify deployment with Traefik's reverse proxy implementation and publicly available docker containers.

This presentation is targeted to folks with "beginner to intermediate" level knowledge. Attendees will benefit most if they have a basic understanding of:

- what docker containers are
- how to run services on a linux server
- using a domain registrar and setting DNS records

I plan to show and explain/walk-through a sample docker-compose.yml file to tie the abstract concepts to a real-world implementation.
