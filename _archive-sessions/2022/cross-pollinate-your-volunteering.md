Become a better volunteer and maybe even a better person by diversifying the kind of organizations you volunteer for. It sometimes feels like FOSS non-profits are re-inventing the wheel with regards to tasks like outreach, volunteer recruitment and retention, community governance and strategic planning. But mission based work has been around for a long, long time and so there's a huge community of non-technical practitioners building community. The value of cross-pollination goes both ways, you can help less technical non-profits think clearly about the role technology plays in their work, while learning about the organizational skills that every volunteer-driven project relies on.

The speaker will discuss the joys of mixing up your volunteering for your own benefit and for the benefit of all the places you give your time to. If you're up for thinking deeply about the kind of volunteer you want to be over the course of your life, then this talk is for you.
