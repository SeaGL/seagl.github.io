Browser engines, and the expectations we place on them, have become incredibly complex. Leading to a situation where while all the dominant engines are nominally opensource it is impossible for practically anyone to exercise their software freedom over them. Except to make them even more complex, once you've wrapped your head around their existing complexity!

This talk will explore existing efforts to address the web's lack of reasonable scope, and demonstrate my own solution "Rhapsode". And explore the potential for a web without JavaScript to better protect privacy & work beautifully across a wider range of devices.
