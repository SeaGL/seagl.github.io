Firefox Multi-Account Containers (FMAC) is a great tool for isolating web sites in a browser session.

FMAC can simplify using accounts on the same multiple web site in the browser.

The addon is from the Firefox project.

FMAC uses containers to block cookies in one tab from accessing cookies in other tabs.

Attendees will know:

* Firefox add-ons
* Firefox containers
* browser privacy
