Containers! Orchestrators! Service Mesh! Serverless! PodSecurity! You've heard all the hype from the many, many projects that call themselves "Cloud Native", but what does it all mean? Why would you want to use any of this, and what tools do you actually need, and why does the CNCF have over 120 projects?

Welcome to the Cloud Native Taqueria, where your questions will be answered. In this talk, we will give you a whirlwind orientation tour of Cloud Native technologies and Mexican food, from Kubernetes to Istio to Tekton to Knative. We'll explain each part of the stack, and why you might or might not want to use it, and how to figure out what your options are.

You'll complete this talk with a better understanding of the Cloud Native universe and what things you want to learn more about.
