We're defining predictive modeling as the intentional building of a model to predict someone's actions and desires. Predictive modeling can be a really useful tool -- it can help us customize environments to our emotional states, anticipate needs, and help us find the things we want even when we don't know we want them. Predictive modeling can also be a scary violation of privacy, letting others know about our inner desires regardless of what we want to share. Even if someone consents to a model being built from them, it is impossible to understand the ways they might be implemented in the future or the direction of technological development.

In this session we'll be talking a bit about ow predictive modeling already exists and ways it could develop in the future; why it is something we should be thinking about; and what sorts of things we can do as individuals and collectives.
