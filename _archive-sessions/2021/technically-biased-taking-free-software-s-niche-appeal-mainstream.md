The Free Software movement's ideals are egalitarian. We aim to bring the benefits of computing freedom to all users. However, we often overlook an uncomfortable inequality: Software Freedom disproportionately empowers programmers and those wealthy enough to hire them.

For today's average "end users", freedomware leaves them with basically the same options as proprietary freeware: use it as-is, or politely ask the developer and hope for the best. In my opinion, this is a key reason why it's difficult to convince the wider public to care; it's why Software Freedom largely remains a movement by and for programmers.

In this talk, I'll argue that:

- Programming education policy is the most important area for Software Freedom advocacy.

- Designing for "nontechnical users" is an existential threat to Free Software.

- Scriptable interfaces are a great way to make software more accessible to tech-illiterate users.
