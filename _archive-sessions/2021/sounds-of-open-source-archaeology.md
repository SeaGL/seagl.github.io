It's indeed useful to get out of your comfort zone from time to time and apply
your engineering skills in some new area. Once upon a time I've got interested
about what kind of simple sound processing one could do using only command line
tools at hand. Knowing nothing about the subject it proved to be a challenge
for a total newbie like me, but an exciting one with pretty interesting
results. The final knowledge was not only tips and tricks about tooling, but
also the story of projects behind those tools, which I would love to share with
you.
