  biography: Elior Sterling is a life long proponent of software freedom. He spent
    the first 15+ years of his career working for companies like Wells Fargo Bank,
    Amazon.com and a string of startups you barely remember. His ideas about the importance
    of Libre software and hardware have been refined in the fires of civic and humanitarian
    projects that affect marginalized people on the outside of the digital divide.
    He has worked on software projects to improve public water service in Tanzania,
    environmental tracking in Guatemala, protection of indigenous lands in Ecuador
    and the US, and the protection of refugees in Jordan and Mexico. In recent years,
    much of his work has revolved around keeping vulnerable people (and their digital
    doppelgangers) safe while facing harassment from individuals, hate groups, and
    governments.

NextCloud is an open source alternative to Google Workspace. It has document editing, time tracking, project management tools, and many more apps that you might want to use in business or activism, but there's a lot that could be made better. YOU can help make it better!

This talk will show you what you need to do to get started with improving the core apps for NextCloud or developing your own using PHP and Javascript.
