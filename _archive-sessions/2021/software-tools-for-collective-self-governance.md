Software systems embed power relationships in their code through their design and in particular through their permissions systems. Even highly collaborative software often relies on the "Benevolent Dictator For Life" model of community and resource management, with a single account given power they may or may not delegate.

While this is the dominant model of governance embedded in technology, it's certainly not the only model. This talk will provide an overview of software projects - most free/open source - which provide ways for governments, institutions, communities, and even groups of internet strangers to govern themselves and their resources in a more democratic way.
