After a year of lockdown, there can no longer be any question as to whether digital rights are human rights. The internet is a single wire that delivers free speech, free assembly, education, family life, romance, parenting, employment, access to politics and civics, to tools and ideas, to community and the public sphere.

And yet, technological self-determination is farther away than ever. Open source means nothing without software freedom (who cares if you can see the source to applications whose essential cloud components you can't modify?). Interoperability is criminalized in new ways every day. A single corporate account termination can cost you your media, your email archives, your mobile device, and even brick your thermostat and doorbell.

Time is running out to seize the means of computation and safeguard the power of tech to give us more control over our lives.
