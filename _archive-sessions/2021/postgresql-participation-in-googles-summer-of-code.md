The [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) community has participated in the international [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program for many years now.  This program is focused on introducing students with developing open source software.

This presentation gives a brief overview of the program, the software projects that the PostgreSQL community mentored, and the commitment needed to have a successful summer.

The PostgreSQL organization's projects ranged from command line utilities, Web applications, testing tools, extensions to PostgreSQL and other database related software.

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
