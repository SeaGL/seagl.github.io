The important concepts in technology and collaboration that were pioneered by the Free Software Movement are *also* pertinent *beyond* software. Both the term "Free Software" and the common acronym FLOSS (*Free / Libre / Open Source Software*) are limited to software programs. So, we use the broader term **FLO** to bring our ethical and creative values to a wide range of other areas. FLO values matter in hardware, science and medicine, governance, music and art, and many other domains.

FLO is about people, communities, and cultures rather than about the products themselves. As Cory Doctorow emphasizes, *information* doesn't want to be free, *people* want to be free. That's why the FLO movement emphasizes people-first principles. FLO encompasses more than licensing and source availability. The FLO world that we wish to see is one in which all of us are both legally and *practically* able to use, study, adapt, and share creative resources in *all* the different facets of our lives.

This session will address why FLO matters as a term as well as a movement. The discussion will be facilitated by three FLO advocates who have experience with hardware and (FLOSS) software, community development, music education and performance, fundraising, and beyond. The audience is invited to participate via a live dialog while we explore getting 'into the FLO'.
