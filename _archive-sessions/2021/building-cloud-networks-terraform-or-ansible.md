  biography: Francois Caen started his career as a SysAdmin at Rackspace. After playing
    with Linux servers for a while, and co-authoring the Linux Toolbox book series,
    he realized that networking is just more fun. As a NetOps engineer, Francois enjoyed
    tinkering with scripting and automation while building and maintaining enterprise
    networks. Francois joined Cisco in 2015 as a Systems Architect in the Public Sector
    Team, and later transitioned to the Global Enterprise Segment, where he assisted
    a Fortune 100 sportswear company in modernizing and automating their network.
    In early 2021, Francois became the Programmability & Automation CoE Lead for Cisco
    Americas Systems Engineering.

While DevOps folks are deploying cloud apps at cloud speed, traditional network engineers are still hand jamming on their routers' CLI like it's 1999. Let's fix that!

In this session, we will show you how to deploy multi-cloud networks in the Infrastructure-as-Code age using modern tooling. And we'll answer the question in every network engineer's mind once and for all: Terraform or Ansible?
