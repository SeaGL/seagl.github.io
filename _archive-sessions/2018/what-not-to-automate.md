  biography: |-
    I'm a software engineer for Puppet, where I'm currently working on our open source remote task runner Bolt. I graduated from Oregon State University with a BS in Computer Science in June 2016, where I worked as a Front-End Engineer for the OSU Open Source Lab. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends, hiking, experiencing new things, and enjoying a wide variety of podcasts, tv shows, blogs, books, and other media.

During a talk at DevOps Days Seattle the speaker stated
"Automate as much as you can". While this seems like an obvious statement at
first blush, on further inspection there are a number of exceptions to this
rule, begging the question: What shouldn't I automate? This talk will give
you a framework for deciding whether something is worth automating. We'll discuss:

* The return on investment of time to automate
* The ethical considerations of automating particular tasks, such as hiring
* Things that require humans intervention
* And more!

We'll consider this question through the lens of economics, business, ethics,
and psychology to explore the wide world of automation and it's consequences.
