You are hiring to fill a position, and you have two great candidates. One has a robust GitHub profile, and the other has no profile at all. Is this an easy choice?

You have heard that having a GitHub profile can help when job hunting. Is it true? How can you get started? What if you don’t have the time?

In this session, we will look at the implications of working in open source, from the perspectives of both the candidate and the hiring manager. Individuals will come away with an understanding of how open source participation affects their hireability, how they can get started, and what to do when active participation is challenging. Hiring managers will come away with an understanding of how to evaluate the open source work of potential candidates, how to evaluate candidates with no history, and how requiring an open source footprint creates harmful bias.
