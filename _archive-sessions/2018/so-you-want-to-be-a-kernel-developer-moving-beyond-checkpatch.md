Many people are interested in kernel development but struggle to get involved. After making a single contribution many people don't know what to do next. Some contributors don't know how to hone their skills, others can't figure out a good project. The focus of this talk is to discuss some of the issues facing new contributors to the Linux kernel who want to take a 'next step' after a first patch and possible solutions. Attendees will come away with some practical ideas about ways to get involved with the Linux kernel community.
