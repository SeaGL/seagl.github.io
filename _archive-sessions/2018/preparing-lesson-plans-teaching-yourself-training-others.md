Being a teacher for 30 years, Lesson Plans are a basic necessity before entering the classroom.  I'll explain why and how we create them.  I recently started training as a Pilates instructor for my personal growth.  When creating lesson plans, my trainer was effusive about how I had devised them.  This comes from many years of teaching - it's almost second nature for me.  In this talk, I'll explain how you can share your knowledge effectively - basically training people in the concepts that you want them to learn.  As I have discovered, you will also learn how to reinforce your own learning for new subjects by preparing lesson plans to teach others.
