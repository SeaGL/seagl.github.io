Websites and the technologies they are built on continue to evolve from the static text documents of old (with the occasional image, tiled background and blinking marquee) to very elaborate pieces of interactive software, with both local and remote code execution that brings all kinds of overlooked privacy and user freedom concerns. Fueled by practicality and monetization incentives, web developers regularly impose non-free JavaScript to their visitors, who also have to suffer being tracked and fingerprinted by all kinds of third parties.

In this talk we will explore the sometimes obscure issues at play, and we will discuss tools and practices for end users to protect their freedom and privacy when browsing the Web, and for site developers to be able to offer an interactive, feature-rich experience to their visitors in freedom-respecting ways.

Attendees will learn about the [JavaScript Trap](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.en.html) and its [solutions](https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/), as well as  [fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint) and other forms of browser [tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_visitor_tracking), and how to work around those and other issues from both the visitor and the webmaster side.
