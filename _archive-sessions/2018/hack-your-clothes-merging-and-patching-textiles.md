Many FLOSS enthusiasts exact perfect control of every bit and byte in their digital lives, but feel helpless at the mercy of clothing manufacturers to mass-produce garments for them. Sewing is an under-appreciated technology which allows you to modify, resize, and even duplicate your proprietary garments, or design your own!

This talk will take a quick spin through the underlying principles of fabric materials and construction, then share everything you need to know to mend, re-shape, or add pockets to your clothes. And of course, we’ll talk about when you should and shouldn’t sew with floss.
