The history of programming is filled with examples of how even the most regular developers discovered how to use their skills to transform the world. With big data, machine learning, and thousands of tutorials at every developer’s fingertips, it is easier than ever to go help causes that we care about. We’ll journey through some incredible projects that were actually very simple ideas that impacted the world, including ones that have secured democracy, allowed transparency in the pharmaceutical industry, and how they were created with all the technology they used. We'll also have a short discussion on developer ethics and what it truly means to be an engineer in today's society and what moral obligation engineers have to create for the greater good.

Then, we will learn about resources that you can use to get started on a project that you care about. I will give examples on how to get free domain names, hosting, and support for your new social good side project and how you can get involved in the social good x tech open source community.
