The open source software ecosystem has seen major changes since the term "open source" was coined and adopted 20 years ago. The scale and complexity of open source projects have increased, professional development practices like software testing at the project level have been introduced, and the infusion of money into development has created a different landscape for contributors and companies.

In this modern world of open source software with the tremendous success in terms of adoption and business investment, is there still a place for individual open source enthusiasts?
