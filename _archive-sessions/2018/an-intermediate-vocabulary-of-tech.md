It is often said that the hardest problem to solve is when two people are talking about different things but believe they are talking about the same thing. As you grow in your engineering career being able communicate about problems effectively is perhaps your single most important skill. This talk exists to distill the breadth of engineering verticals into a quick hit of common vocabulary.

Developers rise through the ranks of their given area of expertise. But what happens when the front end engineer is in charge of solving problems with members of the security team, or the devops team, or the product team? The vocabulary of development is such a critical, but often overlooked, aspect of how we effectively communicate and solve problems across and within groups. It's important to learn how to talk and understand everyone you encounter in your role.

This talk aims to go through the most encountered areas of engineering. Software, DevOps, Security, Program and Product Management. Vocabulary encompasses both the main technologies in the space and the main problem concepts they deal with.
