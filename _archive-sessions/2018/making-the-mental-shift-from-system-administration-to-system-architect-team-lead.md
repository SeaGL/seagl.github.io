Most of the system admins of the past started with being the only IT person and team. So the knowledge level of seeing the overall architecture and need for growth just a part of the everyday thought process. What was not really both forth was you were doing System Architecture just on small level. What happens as the team grows? You not only have you to worry about but others and their roles.

The mental mind shift is how do the following:

- Move from a single mindset to a multi-talented team
- How to build your team on a daily basis
- How to preserve your tech skills and continue to grow
- Are you your worst enemy?
