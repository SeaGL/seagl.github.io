There are currently over 4 billion internet users world wide. With roughly 19% of the world population experiencing some kind of accessibility limitation, the need for developers who are aware of their limitations and trained in best practices for how to limit the impact those limitations have on users is more important than ever.

In this presentation I am going to give a brief overview of some of the most common accessibility issues, what the current best practices and technology offer and some open source projects available. The talk is going to focus on user interfaces with technology.
