What does it take to grow food all year round in the Pacific North West when you are a lazy software engineer? This talk walks through the journey of one who has taken up the challenge of growing food with as much technology and as little effort as possible. The end-result of this journey is one of the most advanced greenhouses in the PNW. Topics include supplemental greenhouse lighting control, energy efficient heating/cooling, visual computing to estimate plant growth, machine learning to predict conditions, automatic irrigation, sensors and monitoring, and much more.
