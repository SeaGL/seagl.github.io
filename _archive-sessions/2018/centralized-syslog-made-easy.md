If you have a lot of servers, then you have a lot of logfiles. If you have a lot of logfiles, then you probably want one place to look at all of them.

This talk will cover:

- How to set up a centralized syslog server
- How to point your other servers' syslog daemons to the centralized server
- Security implications of centralizing syslog
- Security advantages of centralizing syslog
- Best practices and common pitfalls of centralized syslogging
- What to do with all these logfiles

There will be time at the end for Questions And Answers, and the slides, along with a recording of the talk, will be uploaded afterwards.
