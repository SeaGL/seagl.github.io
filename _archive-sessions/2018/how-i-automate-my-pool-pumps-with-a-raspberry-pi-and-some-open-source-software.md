Most Internet-of-Things devices you can buy today tend to be completely proprietary, inflexible, and tied into some would-be data overlord's cloud. But it can be different: in this talk I will to a show-and-tell on my project to automate my swimming pool's pumps using a Raspberry Pi and some open-source software. I now can schedule and monitor what's happening with my pool from the living room couch, at a fraction of the cost of a commercial system, and without lock-in. The message of the talk: you can probably do it, too!
