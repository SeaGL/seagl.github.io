So you’ve released an open source project to the world, people are using it …the hard part is done, right? No, far from it. Open sourcing a project is only a fraction of the effort that will go into it over time. Come to this talk to learn about the hard parts of Open Source Governance and lessons learned from using, contributing, and governing dozens of Open Source projects. Learn how to triage and determine levels of support for issues that come into your projects (open source users are customers!). Also, learn how to handle when something goes wrong – whether it is with your own project or an upstream project two levels up from yours. Want to turn users of your project into contributors? Come hear about best practices both for finding initial contributors and keeping them engaged. Walk away knowing how to handle the hardest (and most rewarding) parts of open source governance.
