Is the project of your dreams ignoring your pull requests? Do you need a way to convince other contributors to improve their documentation? Are you trying to herd cats as a project leader, or simply wondering how to evaluate a project's culture from the outside before getting involved? This talk will explain some basic principles of human motivation and behavior and include examples and story time about applying them in the world of open-source software. It will provide simple heuristics and algorithms for common sources of confusion about human interaction, explained in terms that will make sense to engineers.
