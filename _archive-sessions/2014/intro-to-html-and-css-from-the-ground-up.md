This talk is will be a beginner's guide to Web design, no experience necessary. We'll start by learning the anatomy of an HTML boiler plate, focusing on key tags to know and structural elements. We'll then go over the basics of CSS: inline vs. external styles, and attributes and objects. We'll finish up with some hosting options, and how to get your site into production. By the end of this talk you will know what questions to ask and resources to use in order to write your own simple website and find hosting for it.
