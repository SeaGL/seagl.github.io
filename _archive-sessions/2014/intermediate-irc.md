Do you know how to control what information people can discover about you on an IRC network? What do those "netsplit" messages really mean? What's a "shell" or a "bouncer", and why do people in your channel point out that you're "flapping" when your internet connection gets flaky? What's a "bot", and could you write one? Does it matter whether you connect to irc.networkname or a specific server on that network? Who are Nickserv and Chanserv, and why should you care? This talk will answer all those questions and more, and explain the basics of network topology with dorky clipart drawings.
