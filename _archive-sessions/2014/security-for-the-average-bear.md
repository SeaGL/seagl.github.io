Cybersecurity has been a major topic for the past 15 topic in hacker circles, and has risen to major prominence in the mainstream in the past 3-4 years as Wikileaks, Heartbleed, Lulzsec, and Mr. Snowden have made headlines. Major players such as the NSA, Google, and China are duking it out online. Where does that leave a typical user? How should we respond? Only browse with Tor? Demand HTTPS? Full Disk Encryption? Use of TAILS? Roll our own encryption? Much of the advice available publically does not clearly present itself for non-experts or for who are not reasonably major players. This talk presents a simple and pragmatic framework for risk evaluation and management that can be applied at home or at work, along with selections of current events and software as examples to consider.
