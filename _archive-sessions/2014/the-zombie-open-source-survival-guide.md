Starting out contributing to Open Source can be scary. We've all heard stories that can make the open source community sound less-than-kind to new contributors. It doesn't have to be that way. Using Walking Dead fanfic, you'll get comfortable with some of the tools for contributing to open source like IRC, Git and the GitHub Issue Tracker. By the end of this workshop, you'll have submitted your first pull request to an open source (fanfic) project. We will wrap up with some tips for finding an open source software project you'd like to work on. You'll be well on your way to becoming an OSS contributor!
