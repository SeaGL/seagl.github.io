In this talk, we will look at a selection of ongoing open source projects -- both hardware and software -- that are built to respond to crisis situations. Some of these are disaster response apps and others respond to the needs of places where the crisis is long lasting or even chronic. We'll talk about pop-up infrastructure, building for low power availability and high-latency communications, and about the importance of co-design with the target users for the tools you build. We'll also see how what we learn from refugee camp tech can help us as we face environmental pressures and the decline of the carbon economy in post-industrial nations.
