This talk will begin with a very general introduction to DNS, covering:

  - What DNS is
  - Why it is important
  - How a catastrophic world war might start if it failed
  - Who 'the 13' are.

After introducing some of the basic record types (A,AAAA,CNAME,MX,NS,SOA), I will present an examination of recursive DNS resolution, including walking through manual examples of different DNS queries. This section will include a discussion of authoritative vs nonauthoritative DNS servers. From this point, if there is time, some other topics that could be covered are:

  - DNS hijacking and running your own recursive resolver to avoid this
  - More advanced DNS records
  - Why CNAME records can cause lots of problems if they are used incorrectly.
  - DNS cache poisoning
