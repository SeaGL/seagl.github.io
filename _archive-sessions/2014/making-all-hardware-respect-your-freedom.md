GNU/Linux runs on more kinds of hardware than ever, but often only by requiring proprietary bits. Plus, we now have tablets and phones loaded with nonfree stuff -- how do we get the freedom we all want? The Free Software Foundation has a certification program called "Respects Your Freedom" that awards a certification mark to hardware meeting a set of strict standards. This program has accomplished a lot, especially over the last two years, but even bigger things are planned. Hear about what's in store, and learn about other interactive efforts you can join to improve the compatibility of hardware with free software, as well as the quality of information out there for shoppers.
