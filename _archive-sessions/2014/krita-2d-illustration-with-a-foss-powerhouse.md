Participants will first learn about Krita, how to install it, how to work with a tablet, and why you should use Krita over other software options. Krita's best and brightest features will be shown off. Then we'll dive into a discussion on basic art concepts, such as light & shadow, composition, and color theory. Lastly, we'll finish with a painting demo where I'll draft an illustration and take it as far toward completion as time allows.
