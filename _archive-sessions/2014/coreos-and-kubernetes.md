Kubernetes is an open source manager for Docker containers, based on Googleâ€™s experience using containers at Internet scale. Join Kelsey Hightower of CoreOS to learn more about Kubernetes and hear more about Kubernetes and etcd, CoreOS' distributed key value store. Kelsey will also show us a live demo of Kubernetes and CoreOS in action.
