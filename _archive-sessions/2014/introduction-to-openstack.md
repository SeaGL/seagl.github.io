This will be an introduction to OpenStack. You will learn the names of the parts, how they work together, and how they map(or don't) to their Amazon counterparts. At the end of this presentation you should have a good idea of how the different subsystems inside openstack work together to produce 'cloud.' This is a great talk to go to for anyone who wants to gain a general overview of openstack before they dive into development.
