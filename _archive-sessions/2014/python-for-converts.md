Python is a powerful scripting language that can be used for anything between short few-liners, cron jobs, to full web applications. It's not the language of the week, but it's also not the language of perpetual rewrites. As a long time Perl advocate and now Python convert, Bri will show you what you need to learn to start being proficient in python. This class will discuss the idioms that make python unique, introduce you to the "No, there's really only one way to do it" mindset, and get you past the disdain for forced indentation. We'll tackle actual coding exercizes, and see if we can convert a bunch of things still left around in my ~/bin to python as we go. Prior scripting experience is assumed.
