This talk will cover the creation and management of infrastructure for a free and open source project. Topics will cover systems administration, tool/utility development, interaction design, application development, and team structure. Demonstrations of my favourite tools, such as tmux, will also be included. I'll share my experiences working on the Fedora Infrastructure team, along with words of advice from my fellow team members. Any questions for me are welcome and encouraged.
