Git is the most popular source code management and version control system in the open source community. Its complexity and power make it the best choice for most projects, while simultaneously giving it a daunting learning curve for newcomers. This talk assumes no background knowledge of version control, and will teach the basics of Git in order to give you an accurate mental model of what the tool does, and help you fix mistakes then ask the right questions if you run into problems using it later.
