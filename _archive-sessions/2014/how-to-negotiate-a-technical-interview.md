Convincingly given by a man in a suit, this presentation covers what technical interviewers are trying to learn about you, how to use their questions to figure out if you're likely to be a good fit for the job, and what happens when interviews go hilariously awry. Many technologists are very proficient at solving complex technical challenges. Yet, they feel utterly lost in an interview situation, simply because it's not an occurrence that happens frequently in their lives. This talk explores what technical interviewers are looking to gain from a candidate, how to effectively negotiate a salary, how their questions reveal much about what the job is like, and the best ways to lose a job inside of 25 words.
