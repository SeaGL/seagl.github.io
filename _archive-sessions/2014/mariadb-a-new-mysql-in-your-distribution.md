MariaDB is now shipping in every Linux distribution and is the default MySQL in many. Come to this talk and learn about how to manage the new MySQL with all the advanced options available to both developers and operators. Some highlights include: using authentication plugins, like PAM, using & managing various storage engines: SphinxSE for full-text search, connecting to a Cassandra cluster, making use of ODBC & other various data sources via CONNECT (eg. joining data from Microsoft SQL Server with MariaDB is entirely possible), configuring the threadpool for your workload and taking advantage of new replication features.
