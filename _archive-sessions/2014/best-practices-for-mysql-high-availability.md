The MySQL world is full of tradeoffs and choosing a High Availability (HA) solution is no exception. This session aims to look at all of the alternatives in an unbiased nature. Preference is of course only given to opensource solutions. How do you choose between: MySQL replication, MHA, DRBD, Tungsten, Galera Cluster? Do you integrate Pacemaker and Heartbeat like Percona Replication Manager? Is NDB Cluster right for your workload? The cloud brings even more fun as geographical redundancy is rolled into this.
