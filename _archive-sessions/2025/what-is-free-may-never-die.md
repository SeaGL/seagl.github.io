abstract: Software freedom doesn't just preserve your freedoms as the enduser or developer.
  It makes the software itself immortal.

Software freedom grants a project functional immortality. Legal, economic, organizational, and temporal forces all conspire to destroy software going back to the dawn of recorded software history. We will explore the exact mechanisms for how the free nature of FOSS allows for unparalleled longevity, even in the face of assassination attempts from multi-billion dollar trans-national corporations. We'll look forward in time as well, and chart out a course for the future where all software is free.
