abstract: 'In an era where data privacy and security are paramount, self-hosting an
  email server offers unmatched control, customization, and protection from third-party
  surveillance. "Your Email, Your Rules: Self-Hosting Simplified" empowers Debian
  GNU/Linux users by dispelling myths that self-hosting email is overly complex or
  impractical. Key topics include privacy through data ownership, server/VPS hardening,
  DNS records, server policies, autodiscovery, encrypted transmission and content,
  spam management with sieve, and Roundcube webmail. The presentation concludes by
  delimiting the approach’s scope and provides a roadmap for adjustments needed to
  scale to larger use cases.'

Reclaim your email with a self-hosted Debian GNU/Linux server! This presentation demystifies self-hosting email, proving it’s neither overly complex nor impractical for individuals, families, or small businesses. Learn how to achieve privacy through data ownership, secure your server with encryption (TLS) and authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), optimize delivery with clean DNS management and spam filtering (SpamAssassin, sieve), and provide user-friendly access via Roundcube webmail. We’ll cover server/VPS hardening, autodiscovery, and server policies, offering practical, step-by-step guidance based on proven Debian tools like Postfix and Dovecot. Whether a hobbyist or small business sysadmin, walk away empowered to reclaim your email with confidence!
