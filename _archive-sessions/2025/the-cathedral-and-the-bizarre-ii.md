Git is a major part of modern software development. It is the de facto open source version control platform, enabling developers worldwide to work concurrently without conflicts. Its robust branching and merging features facilitate both parallel development and efficient project management in a culture that encourages the use of Git as a universal tool for managing code in many varied settings and for adapting your dev process to fit its design. This talk will outline the TempleOS development environment, tips and tricks for writing software in the HolyC programming language, and how an operating system without a network stack can still follow modern development practices.
