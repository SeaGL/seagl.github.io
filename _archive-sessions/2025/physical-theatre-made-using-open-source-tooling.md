I've been creating, performing, and touring several full length, high energy mime-inspired shows I describe as "Living Cartoons" for over 10 years at festivals around the USA. Happy to share different pieces or sections of shows, which have been made on shoestring budgets using open source software and open hardware for prop design: laser cutters, synthesizers, etc. You can also learn more about my fascination with DIY and fully open source tooling through my podcast [Linux Prepper](https://podcast.james.network)
