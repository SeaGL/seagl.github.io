  biography: Personally, I am most interested in the ability of collaborative projects
    to mobilize their collective intelligences, to take advantage of all their available
    intellectual labour, in the name of building the commons; in this case, the digital
    commons. I earned a Ph.D. from a collage of urban and public affairs, with a focus
    on similar work.
abstract: Of all the ways we might evaluate a FOSS project, here is some logic behind
  how we can evaluate a group's or community's capacity to mobilize it's intellectual
  labour, and good judgment. With well pin-pointed areas of strengths and weaknesses,
  helpful interventions can be tailored to fit the real-life of a group in its current
  situation.

This is a talk about a method for analyzing a group's ability to reason things out together; a kind of diagnostic tool for participatory democracy. This is an organizational implementation of a socio-political and philosophical work by Jurgen Habermas, and generational experience from secular 'Quaker' business styles.
