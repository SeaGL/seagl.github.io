As AI increasingly powers critical systems across industries, the quality and neutrality of training data have become central to model performance — and to model risk. This talk examines how biased datasets, often stemming from historical imbalances or sampling errors, propagate through machine learning pipelines and influence outcomes at scale. We’ll explore technical pathways through which bias infiltrates — from data labeling and feature selection to model optimization — and demonstrate how even small biases can magnify under automation. Drawing from real-world case studies, we’ll discuss frameworks for bias detection, debiasing techniques, and evaluation methodologies to build more robust, fair, and accountable AI systems.
