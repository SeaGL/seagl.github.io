the Anti-Meta Fedi Pact at <https://fedipact.online/> is an organized effort
to block Meta's Threads platform. it formed as soon as news of fediverse integration
in a Meta product was leaked, and for a while was a campaign of preemptive defederation.
this talk will delve into my personal reasons for starting the pact as well as those
of others i have witnessed. it will talk about the history and experience of running
such a project, how it has affected me and what i would do differently if i had
the foresight of what i know now. it will expand on <https://fedipact.online/why>
considerably :3
