  biography: |-
    Originally based in San Francisco, hacker and entrepreneur Evan Prodromou now lives in Montreal where he is the Research Director at the Social Web Foundation, where he helps develop and promote the ActivityPub standard.

    A passionate advocate of Open Source and Open Content, Evan is best known for founding the Free travel guide project, Wikitravel. He is the Chair of the W3C Social Web Working Group and the author of ActivityPub: Programming for the Social Web (O’Reilly Media).
abstract: As Free and Open Source Software enthusiasts, we sometimes concentrate on
  our own experiences with software, hardware and data. But in the world of social
  networks, our own computing is deeply intertwined with that of our friends and family,
  colleagues and neighbours. Open Web standards let us stay connected to people that
  matter to us while using and building free, private, and technically enhanced systems.
  And we might even change some hearts and minds along the way!

Social networks are a ubiquitous part of our life -- about 2/3 of all Internet users use social media platforms on a regular basis. They help us connect to family and friends, meet people from around the world who share our common interests, and read and discuss local, national and global news.

But social networks have a dark side, too. Their algorithmic feeds can be psychologically addictive, and lead to anti-social behaviour that's bad for society and for our own mental health. The huge amount of data that we share with social network platforms has dubious stewardship, and is often shared with marketers to target us with ads. Most of all, the platforms are locked down, disallowing most interesting hacking, data mining, and optimization for your own use.

As hackers, when we don't like how technology works, we make our own. But in the case of social software, that's not enough -- we need to keep connected to the people who matter to us, and the politicians and thinkers who shape our world. How can we make our own social software that keeps us connected to others?

ActivityPub is an open web standard from the W3C. Patent- and royalty-free, collaboratively developed, it lets Free Software developers connect to commercial platforms and free ones alike. The network of ActivityPub-enabled services, dubbed the Fediverse, is a burgeoning coalition of social networks that interoperate with open standards.

In this talk, Evan will give a gentle introduction to using ActivityPub-enabled services to get on the Fediverse. He'll talk about the challenges and successes of open social networks, and give some insights based on his 15+ years of building and fighting for the open social web.
