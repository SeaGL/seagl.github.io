Open research benefits researchers, institutions, and science in general: but open science practices and open source for research software aren’t always taught in universities. This talk will present a success story for filling the gaps: the Digital Research Academy. Based in Germany but working across Europe, the DRA is building a community of trainers to bridge knowledge gaps, cultivate innovation, and drive positive change through continuous learning and re-adapting. The DRA focuses on open science, data literacy and open source research software engineering: so far, we have trained over 700 people across 50+ academic institutions. This presentation will share the DRA model, success stories, and how to get involved!
