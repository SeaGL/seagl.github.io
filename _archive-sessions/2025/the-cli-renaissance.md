As AI reshapes our digital interfaces, command lines aren't fading—they're evolving. This talk examines why CLIs remain essential in an AI-driven world and how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents their future. Drawing from my experience building AWS SAM CLI, I'll demonstrate how CLIs provide precision and composability that AI alone cannot match. MCP, an open protocol, creates a powerful bridge where AI can leverage CLI capabilities while preserving user control and privacy. Through live demonstrations, you'll witness a new paradigm where deterministic command lines and intuitive AI combine to create superior developer experiences, not the end of CLIs, but their renaissance.
