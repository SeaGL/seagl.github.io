This 20 min. talk will give an overview of OpenTofu with examples for deploying infrastructure in the public AWS Cloud using OpenTofu. As time permits, I will run the code examples used to deploy and scale these deployments, while retaining a remote state of the infrastructure in a secure location suitable for production deployments.
