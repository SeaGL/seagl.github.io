  Do you need to search plain text files?

  Do you have big files? Lots of tiny files?

  How about inline searching of command output?

  Introducing "grep"!!!

  Find out if grep is the tool for you!

  Watch as your fingers never leave your hands while you slice and dice plain text!

  Be amazed as you quickly search through mountains of text to find what you're looking for.

  But, wait, there's more.

  There's an entire grep family of tools!

  * egrep for advanced regular expressions
  * fgrep to ditch the regular expressions
  * rgrep to recursively search a filesystem

  There are also the compression and archival cousins such as:

  * bzgrep
  * zgrep
  * xzgrep
  * ptargrep

  Those family members also come as accessory command line switches.

Find out if grep is the tool for you!

Watch as your fingers never leave your hands while you slice and dice plain text!

Be amazed as you quickly search through mountains of text to find what you're looking for.

But, wait, there's more.

There's an entire grep family of tools!

* egrep for advanced regular expressions
* fgrep to ditch the regular expressions
* rgrep to recursively search a filesystem
* pgrep to search the process table

And they can combine to be more powerful than Voltron[0]!

There are also the compression and archival cousins such as:

* bzgrep
* zgrep
* xzgrep
* ptargrep

Those family members also come as accessory command line switches.

Use now and you can take advantage of even more command line arguments.

grep: the text tool that slices and dices!

Act now and all of these fabulous tools ( except Voltron ) can be yours, coming from a distribution repository near you!

Warning: Use of grep may lead to exposure of regular expression! You might never be able to return to an ordinary life.

Warning: Use of regular expressions in the presence of cats may lead to hours of debugging as they walk across the keyboard creating random strings indistinguishable from regular expressions!
