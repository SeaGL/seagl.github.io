    Kasanwa Solane "KaSo" Aster Hope is an ace autistic panromantic polyamorous tonsi who works at a big tech company in the area (working on software engineering projects completely unrelated to faer presence at SeaGL).
    Originally from Miami, FL, KaSo is happy to have moved to Seattle approximately a year and a half ago (July 2024).

abstract: the Anti-Meta Fedi Pact at https://fedipact.online/ is an organized effort
  to block Meta's Threads platform. it formed as soon as news of fediverse integration
  in a Meta product was leaked, and for a while was a campaign of preemptive defederation.
  this talk will delve into my personal reasons for starting the pact as well as those
  of others i have witnessed. it will talk about the history and experience of running
  such a project, how it has affected me and what i would do differently if i had
  the foresight of what i know now. it will expand on https://fedipact.online/why
  considerably :3
