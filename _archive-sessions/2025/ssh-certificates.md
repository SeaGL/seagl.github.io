SSH certificates improve both security and usability. No more TOFU (trust on first use) when you log in. Time-bound keys for access to limit the blast radius of a stolen or compromised key. We'll show how certificates are used and improve upon identity/pubkey authentication, and introduce several open source tools for managing them.
