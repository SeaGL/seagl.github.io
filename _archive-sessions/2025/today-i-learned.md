  biography: Dr. Kaylea Champion studies how people cooperate to build groovy public
    goods like GNU/Linux and Wikipedia, including what gets maintained and the risks
    we face. She is an Assistant Professor in Computing and Software Systems at the
    University of Washington Bothell, where she teaches software engineering with
    an emphasis on cybersecurity and evidence-based practices. Dr. Champion is eager
    to build connections with communities, and has given talks at FOSSY, Quantum Wednesday,
    Norwescon, WorldCon, PyConUS, the OpenJS Summit, Wikimania, MozFest, Women in
    Data Science, PuPPY, DebConf, and SeaGL. A Linux user since 1994, she enjoys tromping
    through the woods, smashing goblins, conjuring data, and cooking for a crowd.
abstract: Friends, it's time once again to review the newest research findings about
  FLOSS. What's new in 2025? How are we continuing to thrive despite upheaval and
  AI slop? What works, what needs improvement, and what's changing? I'll give you
  a short tour through this year's most exciting findings.

Academics around the globe study FLOSS communities and their development practices. In this talk, we'll explore the very latest findings and trends in research about building, using, and sustaining free software, including AI, cybersecurity, and scientific work. I'll extract key observations that you can bring to your community and workplace, and we'll think together about how to build better partnerships between the academy and communities.
