Ada’s Technical Books & Café is where the technical mind finds what it craves.

And where a bookstore becomes a community.

Our store sits in Capitol Hill, Seattle. And is home to the kinds of books, gifts, workshops and events, that beckon to the geek {and the geek in all of us.}

Because we believe in never-ending learning, evolving, and collaboration, {and hanging out while doing it.}

So you can find the knowledge you seek, feed your curiosity among friends, and always feel in your element.
