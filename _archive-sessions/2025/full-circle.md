  biography: |-
    I am delighted to work with the Open Program Office of [Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/open-source.html)! This role is the culmination of my prior lives as a computer programmer, lawyer and adjunct professor specializing in intellectual property subjects including open source.

    I am admitted to practice law in Ohio, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, and in-house in Washington. While in private practice, I served for two years as President of CincyIP, a local bar association dedicated to intellectual property education. I served as adjunct professor at the University of Cincinnati School of Law and University of Dayton School of Law on subjects including Patent Litigation, Cyberspace Law and Open Source Licensing.

Being the Compliance Manager of the Open Program Office of [Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/open-source.html) is the culmination of my prior lives as a computer programmer, lawyer and adjunct professor specializing in intellectual property subjects including open source. I'll discuss my start in computer programming and how I first became acquainted with open source along with the lessons I've learned along the way to maximize my impact in the Open Program Office at HPE.
