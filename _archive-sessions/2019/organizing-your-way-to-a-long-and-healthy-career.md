What does it take to have a 10- or 20-year career in tech — or even longer? We could talk about the hard work and technical skills, mentoring and collaboration, and privilege that can be involved. There’s one big way we can increase the odds for all of us though, and that’s to organize. From #talkpay to unionization, you’ll learn about the skills and tactics that will give us the opportunity to continue our tech work in the healthiest way over time.
