What if `sudo apt install imagemagick` or `sudo dnf install imagemagick` gets an old version or one missing the features you need? You need to find a 3rd party build or manually compile and install from source. I'll show you how Docker and Snap can be used to create packages with the features you need that can be used without cluttering up your system with a manual install.
