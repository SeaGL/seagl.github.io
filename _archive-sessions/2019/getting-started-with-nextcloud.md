In this presentation I plan to introduce Nextcloud and provide examples of how to get started using it. This will include:.

* History of Nextcloud
* Why should you use Nextcloud instead of Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.
* Ways to get a Nextcloud instance
  * Self-hosted at home
  * VPS
  * Service provider
* How I use my Nextcloud server
  * Cal and CardDav
  * Note taking
  * File sync
  * Online office suite
* Q&A

I am open to this talk being in either a 30 min or 50 min slot. It will scale easily.
