And they're back! Join Karen and Bradley as they record a *live* episode of Free as in Freedom (their podcast about legal, policy, and many other issues in the free and open source software world), for the first time with a live studio audience. The recording will begin with a brief chat about the conference and then move to topic suggestions and questions from you, the audience.  Stop by the Conservancy booth during the conference to submit your questions in advance. Bradley and Karen will be ready to talk about copyleft enforcement, diversity initiatives in free software, timely news stories and anything else you think they should discuss.
