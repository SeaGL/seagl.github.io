Learn how to draw and paint in Krita, the 2D illustration program that puts brushes at the forefront of your workflow. Attendees will learn the principle workflows and conventions behind Krita, such as brushes, colors, and layers. Traditional artistic skills will also be covered, with a focus on how to draw and paint like a professional, and how Krita's interface corresponds to real world art materials. Follow along through a process demo that shows how to take a loose drawing through to a finished colored illustration. Lastly, get answers to your toughest art questions with some Q&A at the end. If you've got a tablet or stylus laptop, bring it along and join in the drawing fun!
