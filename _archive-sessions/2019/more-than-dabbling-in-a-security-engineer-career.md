Becoming as Security Engineer: This presentation only hints at recommendations and is not prescriptive for entering the security field. It willingly suggests that other parts of life keep happening. Other smoke and mirrors are revealed in this talk but... quality time advocating high priority fixes, plowing bug bounty programs, presenting security topics for Toastmasters, searching job sites, informational interviews, meet-ups, and obtaining a CISSP certificate all helped for a timely career change for the speaker.
