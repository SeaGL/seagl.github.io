This talk will cover using your computer to control your model trains.  It's pretty easy; just need a laptop (or other computing device) with enough resources to run a Java based graphical application, an Arduino Uno, Arduino motor shield, 15vdc power supply, and some time to set it all up.  I will cover JMRI for the laptop, and DCC++ on the Arduino.
