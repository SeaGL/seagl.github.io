HTTP, first defined in 1991, has undergone radical change since it was created by Tim Berners-Lee in the days of dialup. We'll cover the notable problems and improvements from 0.9 up to the proposed HTTP/3 which sheds TCP entirely and implements a secure and highly performant TLS-over-UDP protocol known as QUIC.

No prior knowledge of HTTP or networking is required, but even those comfortable writing web requests at the command line will learn a thing or two.
