  biography: I got my first personal computer in 1969.  From there, I have fascinated
    by ones and zeros, although I don't know why because if you've seen one one, you've
    seen them all and the zeroes are nothing to look at, either.  I've worked at Boeing,
    Mathsoft, the UW, Real Networks, F5 Networks, Google, Sweetlabs, Impinj, Juniper
    Networks, Amazon, and now at AT&T.

It's fairly common knowledge about the tools available to troubleshoot a network, but it is not so common as to know which tool to use, or how to use the tools together in order to figure out the problem and how to fix it.

In this workshop, I am going to discuss the OSI model (and how it sort of kind of fits the TCP/IP model) and then go up the stack to show what can go wrong at each level, how to diagnose it, and how to fix it.

I gave a similar presentation at LinuxFest in April 2017.  It was well-received, however, there are some things I have learned since then that will make the presentation more relevant to home networks.

See [the slides from the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRcSREMJnCt5tgcPVzrzvxWDGq4aBnAz5zF2JFNa70fvIk_-GrvP-70GXqx8ILQ-4BFafgmoH_NS3JQ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).
