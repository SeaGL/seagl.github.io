Yep, that language you forgot about after Comp Sci 101 is still alive and kicking! We'll explore the present and future of this ancient language, with a focus on Common Lisp:

* The general state of the Common Lisp language and development tools today, including some of the crazy things you can do with Emacs!
* StumpWM and the Next browser, examples of useful Common Lisp applications for the Linux desktop.
* Tools like `parenscript` which are putting Lisp on the client-side of the web.

By the end of this presentation, you should be inspired to go home, install Emacs, and start `(meta-)*programming`!

NOTE: I didn't realize quite how short this presentation had to be, so be ready for some sort of Lisp-related presentation that won't closely follow the bullet points above!
