Free/libre and open source software has unlocked countless digital innovations. At the same time, we’ve seen these projects struggle to be sustainable, secure and inclusive.

In her talk, Abby will explore how the principles of open leadership —understandable, extensible, participatory— provide a necessary base to solve the toughest problems we face today. We’ll apply lessons from mentoring over 500 open projects to how we can intentionally design our projects to be open.
