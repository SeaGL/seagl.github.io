How open source software is already being used in crises and how the open source community can help in crises situations -- before the crisis hits, and during the crisis itself.

I intend to talk about how open source in general gives crisis management teams affordable and customizable tools to deal with the challenges they face, and that direct cooperation with developers means that the tools can be made better, faster. I'll talk about the impact of humanitarian hackathons like RHoK, and the need for long term volunteers who can continue to work on projects at a series of hackathons and between those hackathon events. And finally I'll talk about how people can lend their expertise in an effective way during crisis situations.
