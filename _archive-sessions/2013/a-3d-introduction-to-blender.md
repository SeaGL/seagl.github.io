The 3D program Blender is a poster child for FOSS graphics done right, with fast development, an abundance of features, and professional results that rival commercial 3D packages. Blender's capabilities make it useful for media, technical visualization, 3D printing, and a multitude of other industries, but it can be difficult for beginners to know where to start.

First we'll take a brief look at the 3D pipeline in a nutshell through some production files. After that, learn the basics of Blender with a live demo of the starting interface. Get pointed toward other useful Blender resources, including Seabug: the Seattle Blender User Group.

Users participating in the live demo should bring a 3-button mouse.
