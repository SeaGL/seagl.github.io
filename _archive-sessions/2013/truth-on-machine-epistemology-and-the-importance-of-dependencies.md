Have you ever started a new sysadmin job, asked for a list of managed systems, and received blank looks in response, or half-hearted guesses, or pointers to six different places where you could dig up the information? Could you quickly provide such a list in your current position, and know without a doubt that it was accurate and complete? Do you know precisely where every system you manage is located, which version of an OS it's running, and what it does? How easily can you find any system's serial number? In this presentation, we'll talk about how to make all this possible, with a single repository of system truth.
