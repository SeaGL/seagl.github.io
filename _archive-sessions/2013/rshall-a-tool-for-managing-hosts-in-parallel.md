Once you're managing more than a handful of UNIX/Linux boxes, a tool that lets you run commands on multiple hosts becomes pretty handy. When you're responsible for dozens or more, such a tool is an indispensable productivity enhancer. rshall makes it easy to run commands on many UNIX or Linux hosts on a network. The commands run in parallel, so output returns quickly and changes are nearly simultaneous. It's great for ad hoc information gathering, and for making changes in the absence of a centralized configuration management system. Learn how to make the most of rshall in this presentation.
