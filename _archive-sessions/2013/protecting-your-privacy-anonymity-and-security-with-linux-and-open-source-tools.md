This talk is meant to give an overview of the available tools and configurations for basic through advanced level security and privacy measures. We will discuss example configurations, communications, and on-going operational security. All slides and presentation notes will be available for download. The talk will not include specific instructions for setup, but will have several resources available in the downloadable materials.
