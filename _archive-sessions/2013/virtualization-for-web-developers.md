Hypervisors are great tools to use to spread GNU/Linux by installing and operating it virtually from a host desktop machine regardless of brand. Virtualization is also demonstrated as a valuable way to spreading GNU/Linux in the community. In my talk I use Oracle VirtualBox, but I am open to other solutions.

A few configurations are needed to extend its use as a development environment for web developers, and is a massive improvement over earlier methods for web development from the desktop. There will be a discussion of the technical configurations for individual and team use, as well as what are the social benefits to the enterprise after adopting virtualization solutions.

New offerings, such as distributions of middleware embedded with a full server stack represent the evolution in how we can deploy software solutions to the internet.

TL; DR: I am here to talk about a better way for web developers to work. It is very flexible to the kind of team and project worked on.
