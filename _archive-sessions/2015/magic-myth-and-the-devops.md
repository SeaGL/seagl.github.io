"Once upon a time":  powerful words that begin many oral
narratives and indicate that the story to be told will be imbued
with magic and myth.  Organizational folklore can be a very powerful
force for instilling or perpetuating behavior, systems, and culture
within an organization.

Too often, fear and negativity are the driving forces in the folklore
behind many organizational traditions.  A positive narrative that
embraces the customs and traditions of a healthy, balanced feedback
loop can help jumpstart your DevOps journey.  This talk will help you
frame your narrative alongside metrics and use folklore as a catalyst
for positive change.
