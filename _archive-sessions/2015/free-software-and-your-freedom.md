  biography: Since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time in political
    advocacy for free software, and spreading the ethical ideas of the movement, as
    well as campaigning against both software patents and dangerous extension of copyright
    laws. Before that, Richard developed a number of widely used programs that are
    components of GNU, including the original Emacs, the GNU Compiler Collection,
    the GNU symbolic debugger (gdb), GNU Emacs, and various others.

The Free Software Movement campaigns for computer users' freedom to cooperate and control their own computing. The Free Software Movement developed the GNU operating system, typically used together with the kernel Linux, specifically to make these freedoms possible.
