The New York Times has been innovating journalism with technology for the past 164 years.   Since our first website launched in 1996, we’ve faced the unique challenges of running a high-traffic website from the moment we launched, something incredibly challenging for a company where digital started off as an afterthought. Without the open source tools available today, this required building web servers, ad networks, and caches all from scratch.

The Times has been around a long time and will be around for the foreseeable future. This presents a unique problem-how do you build software to last decades? Any piece of software we build is immediately in the hands of hundreds of thousands of users and we have core pieces of our architecture that have lasted 10, even 20 years.

We’ll talk about some of the mistakes we’ve made, the huge diversity of tools that go into the New York Times, and what we’ve done and are doing to continue to move fast while innovating journalism at scale. We’ll look how we’re using microservices, continuous delivery, and API management to make our 164 year old newsgathering machine continue to “enhance society by creating, collecting and distributing high-quality news and information” for the next century.
