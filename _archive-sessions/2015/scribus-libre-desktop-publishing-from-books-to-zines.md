Whether creating a program for your free software conference or a zine for your friends, the GPL-licensed desktop publishing program Scribus is for you.

Working from my own experience creating print publications for the Free Software Foundation, and assuming no prior desktop publishing experience, I will give an overview of Scribus, explain how to install it, and walk through the creation of a simple, multi-page document. The discussion will cover why Scribus is the best choice for your project, and briefly examine other libre programs that complement it, including GIMP and Inkscape.
