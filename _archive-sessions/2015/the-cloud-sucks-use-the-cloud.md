Clouds suck. We'll explain the shortcomings of both Amazon and OpenStack clouds. We'll share our first-hand experiences with cloud failures and other failures resulting from using the cloud. These failures should amuse and terrify any sysadmin. After fully convincing you that clouds are terrible, we'll come back and show you why they are the best option and you should use them.
