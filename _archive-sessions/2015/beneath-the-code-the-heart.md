Free software are tools that can be studied, changed, and shared. But what is the free software community?  United by values more than methodology, we perform a variety of tasks and develop an abundance of projects.  This talk shares the stories of people in and around free software - users and developers, teachers and testers, programmers and philosophers.  We’ll talk about the paths we’ve taken, the obstacles we’ve faced, and the shared values that inspire us to grow as individuals and as a community.
