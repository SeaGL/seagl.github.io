Popularized by GitHub, ChatOps is putting tools in the middle of the conversation.  Using recent additions to SaltStack in the form of runners, returners & engines, popular chat methods such as XMPP, Slack, & IRC can be used for a variety of things such as orchestrating virtual machine deployments, minion monitoring and software upgrades.  This talk will primarily focus on demonstrations of the features mentioned above.
