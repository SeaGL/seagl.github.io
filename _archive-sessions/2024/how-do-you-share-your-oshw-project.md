  biography: |-
    Sean has a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in design of mechanical systems, from the University of Irvine, California. He is currently studying permaculture design.

    He worked as an associate mechanical design engineer for Max Q Systems - formerly an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for aerospace industry. He served as the GreenHab Officer at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS). He is also a contributor for the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) open standards working group, Tetra Bio Distributed (US non-profit organization) developing open-source hardware medical/PPE devices, and the Mach 30 Foundation developing the distributed open-source hardware framework (DOF)
abstract: How do you share your OSHW projects? Does your process help keep things
  like the BoM and assembly instructions in sync? Is it easy to re-use parts from
  other projects (yours or someone elseâ€™s)? Can you easily fork your projects? How
  difficult is it for you to certify (or re-certify) your projects as OSHW? If you
  have a process that addresses all these needs, we want to hear about it. And if
  not, we want to hear how a new process could best support your needs. Join our live
  discussion on what works in sharing OSHW projects and what still needs improvement.
  Your input will be included in a public report on how the community shares projects
  and will guide development of formal processes and tools for sharing OSHW.

Workshop Agenda:

1. Opening: Poll the audience for their experience (successes/pain-points) in Open Source Hardware development
2. Review Stakeholder Needs: Share identified stakeholder needs (requirements/expectations) for OSHW development tools with audience
3. Solicit user-stories: Live exercise to collaboratively define user stories for OSHW development tools
4. Closing: Summarize workshop outcomes and identify next steps
