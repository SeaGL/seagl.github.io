    He worked as an associate mechanical design engineer for Max Q Systems - formerly an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for aerospace industry. He served as the GreenHab Officer at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS). He is also a contributor for the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) open standards working group, Tetra Bio Distributed (US non-profit organization) developing open-source hardware medical/PPE devices, and the Mach 30 Foundation developing the distributed open-source hardware framework (DOF)
abstract: How do you share your OSHW projects? Does your process help keep things
  like the BoM and assembly instructions in sync? Is it easy to re-use parts from
  other projects (yours or someone else’s)? Can you easily fork your projects? How
  difficult is it for you to certify (or re-certify) your projects as OSHW? If you
  have a process that addresses all these needs, we want to hear about it. And if
  not, we want to hear how a new process could best support your needs. Join our live
  discussion on what works in sharing OSHW projects and what still needs improvement.
  Your input will be included in a public report on how the community shares projects
  and will guide development of formal processes and tools for sharing OSHW.

Workshop Agenda:

1. Opening: Poll the audience for their experience (successes/pain-points) in Open Source Hardware development
2. Review Stakeholder Needs: Share identified stakeholder needs (requirements/expectations) for OSHW development tools with audience
3. Solicit user-stories: Live exercise to collaboratively define user stories for OSHW development tools
4. Closing: Summarize workshop outcomes and identify next steps
