Mailing lists are like super neat. the offer a really cool decentralized, platform agnostic way of contributing to FLOSS.
Even with the advent of more GUI web based platforms, many large projects still use them for development; stuff like GCC and the linux kernel.
But using them can be a bit.. weird, or even scary to say the least.
Join me as I dive headfirst into this text based tributary of our shared cultural heritage to learn the ins,
the outs, the trailing whitespaces and the mime types of this battle tested dev system. We're gonna learn about some history, practice some etiquette, use some tools and talk pros and cons of using a mailing list for your project.
