Enterprise GIS (geographic information system) deployments have long been considered notoriously difficult and expensive, particularly for non-profits, hobbyists, and other small organizations. Barriers to entry such as these, as well as the domination of proprietary GIS software in North America and Europe, has made wide-scale open source GIS adoption difficult to achieve. In this presentation, you will learn about the geoCML Project and how it aims to alleviate these issues by bringing full-scale enterprise GIS deployments to the masses with its FOSS geoCML Deployment Pattern.
