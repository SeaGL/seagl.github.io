I am a reviewer for eBird, one of the largest community scientist platforms in the world, where people submit checklists of birds they saw. Reviewers go over these records, looking for aberrant observations, incorrectly tagged media, and records which need just a little bit more detail. With around 100 million checklists to review, this task can take a lot of time! In this talk, I'll go over this process, and talk about how I and a few other reviewers use open source tooling written in R to make this process a bit easier.
