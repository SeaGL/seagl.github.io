With so many new projects arriving on the scene every year, it's easy to lose sight of the fact that it's about more than code. A successful FOSS project and community needs a solid governance structure to ensure the safety and productivity of its members and users.

Governance is a tricky thing, but thankfully we can do what all good FOSS Folks do: we can learn from and build upon the work of those who came before us.

In this talk I'll talk about some of the most commonly applied governance elements for FOSS projects, why you might want to use them for your FOSS project, show you many different examples of governance structures, and provide you with a resource for finding more examples that you can build upon for your project's needs.
