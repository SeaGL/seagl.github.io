A comparison of two Free Software distributions that strive to be
trustworthy, Debian and GNU Guix.

This talk delves into how each project approaches fundamental security
features through Reproducible Builds, Bootstrappable Builds, code
auditability, etc. to improve trustworthiness, allowing independent
verification; trustworthy projects require little to no trust.

Exploring the challenges that each project faces due to very different
technical architectures, but also contextually relevent differences in
social structure, adoption patterns, and organizational history should
provide a good backdrop to understand how different approaches to
security might evolve, with real-world merits and downsides.
