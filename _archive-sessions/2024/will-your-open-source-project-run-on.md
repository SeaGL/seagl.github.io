  biography: Elizabeth K. Joseph is a Linux systems administrator who now leads the
    Open Source Program Office for IBM Z where she works with the community to explore
    Linux and z/OS workloads on mainframes. In the course of her career, she's worked
    on Raspberry Pis and Sun SPARC systems, so working on non-x86 architectures full
    time was a natural fit. She has previously worked on distributed systems and has
    written books on Ubuntu and OpenStack.

You probably developed your open source project for a single, "default" architecture like x86, but today there is considerable growth in other architectures, from ARM to mainframes to RISC-V. The talk will present some of the tools available to open source software developers to port their projects to other architectures.
