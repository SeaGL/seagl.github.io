  biography: Andrew is a long time software developer and Linux user who tinkers with
    a variety of fabrication tools in his free time.
abstract: With the wide availability of inexpensive and easy to use DIY fabrication
  machines, manufacturing your own physical items is in reach of more people than
  ever before. We'll look at the landscape of software available to design and fabricate
  your own designs from Linux and FOSS software stack.
