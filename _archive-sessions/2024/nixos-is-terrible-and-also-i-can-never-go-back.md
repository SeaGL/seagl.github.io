I use NixOS btw, the hot new distro that all the Arch Linux users have been hopping to. It's a complete overhaul of how linux filesystems are usually laid out. It boasts easy rollbacks of software & config by default, the biggest software repository, and being able to configure everything about your system from one file.

NixOS is also a frustrating experience sometimes. You have to learn a new programming language. The documentation is messy and incomplete. The community is split on many things. There's two ways to do everything.

In this talk, I hope to give you an asterisks-included overview of NixOS and why you should use it.
