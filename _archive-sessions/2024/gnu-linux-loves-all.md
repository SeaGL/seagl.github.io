  biography: Timmy is passionate about the philosophy of FLO (Free/Libre/Open) software.
    He is happy to be using GNU/Linux for his musical compositions and performances.
    He loves to tell others about his great experiences with FLO software. Timmy's
    music is inspired by FLO technologies including GNU/Linux, Matthew Autry's skip-fretting,
    and Kite guitar. These technologies have connected him with notes outside of modern
    standard tuning. Rather than being limited to just one tuning, Timmy's music is
    inspired by both the harmonic series and various edos beyond just 12edo (standard
    tuning). He finds a unique sound from the intersection between ancient tuning
    theory, modern music technology, and a FLO philosophy.
abstract: Timmy James Barnett plays FLO music using a GNU/Linux laptop. He plays various
  instruments including violin, microtonal guitars, and microtonal keyboards.
