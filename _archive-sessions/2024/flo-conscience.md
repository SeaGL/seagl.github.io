abstract: |-
  Free/Libre/Open (FLO) methods can apply well beyond software. This talk is the first big announcement of the FLO Conscious Living (CL) project.

  FLO-CL collects and organizes mental models and practices for living in more healthy, intentional, and ethical ways. As a FLO project, everyone is invited to participate in its evolution.

Our world is overflowing with advice on leadership, communication, wellness, spirituality, and related topics. People keep adding yet more books, videos, podcasts, and blog posts to the zillions of lifetimes' worth of "content" we already have. FLO methods offer an alternative approach where we can better *cooperate* on building shared resources.
