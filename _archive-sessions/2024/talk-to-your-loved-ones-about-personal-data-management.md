  biography: Rachel is a long-time nerd and denizen of the internet, learning to form
    community without social media! A proud career-switcher, she has worked for tech
    companies small and large since 2014 and has been happily plugging away at Fastly
    for the last several years as an SRE on the Certificate Authority project. A staunch
    advocate of community and locality, Rachel now uses skills learned from many years
    of co-organizing Portlandâ€™s PyLadies chapter and participating in many community-oriented
    technology user groups toward something completely different. She and her partner
    live in Portland, OR, going to too many Burning Man events (not possible) and
    training for simply too many races of all kinds (also not possible). You can reach
    Rachel at her email, <rkrk@rkode.com>.

Hey! You're special! And so are the people you love. AND SO IS THEIR DATA. If we all had a dollar for every time someone said "Well, Facebook has all my data, so what's the difference if they've got just a little more?", we could finally buy that SeaGL Conference Yacht we've all been dreaming of. And you know all this! So come for a discussion of how to positively and lovingly suggest ways to be a little safer while not losing your mind or your community.
