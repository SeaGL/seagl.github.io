Come give a SeaGL talk with no preparation required - or available! SeaGL 2023 had a talk where the slides were available but the presenter was not, so we crowdsourced the talk and it was a huge hit. This year we're doing it intentionally. This slot will have 10 five minute talks on a variety of Linux, Open Source, techie topics. We'll pass the presenter mic around liberally and see if we can keep ourselves on our toes and learn a thing or two from each other!
