abstract: In this session we'll discuss the 6 principles of tensegrity structures
  and explore them by building simple models. All materials will be provided!

Put the term "tensegrity" into your favorite image search, and you'll find a wide variety of structures which defy common assumptions about the laws of physics. But these structures are entirely real, and we can easily build them from simple components!

We'll discuss the principles of tensegrity, then use common office supplies (paperclips, rubber bands, and straws) to create classic modules which you can take home with you.
