We’ll explore how Apache SeaTunnel revolutionizes data integration with its robust capabilities. It excels in cross-cloud data integration, breaking down silos for a unified data environment, and supports over 160 data sources, allowing seamless connection and analysis of diverse data. SeaTunnel's high-performance capabilities in both batch and stream processing make it stand out, providing superior speed and efficiency. To illustrate its real-world impact, I’ll share a case study from JP Morgan & Chase, demonstrating how they used SeaTunnel to streamline data integration processes and achieve significant performance improvements.
