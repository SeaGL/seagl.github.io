How can we work together to build more awesome communities to sustain open source projects?

What can academia can tell us about solving our real-world problems in FLOSS?

In this beginner-friendly talk, I will describe recent research findings about successfully sustaining an open source project and the lifecycles of these projects. I'll sprinkle in a few FLOSS-friendly observations from the information systems, empirical software engineering, and organizational leadership fields, too.

You'll walk away with:
* new ideas for taking action personally and inside organizations
* specific data-driven insights into how projects evolve over time
