Dual-booting is a useful method to run two operating systems on the same machine. Different OSes might help you harness the full potential of your hardware, or it may be necessary because of software limitations. It lets you tailor your computing experience to your own unique needs. Yet few people run different operating systems from the same disk partition, where both OSes coexist in the same place in the same file system. This talk will outline the steps to combine Linux with another open source OS known as TempleOS in a very small amount of disk space, and how blending them together can create a unique and fun programming experience.
