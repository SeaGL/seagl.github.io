abstract: Coreboot has been around for a number of years by now, but with each new
  year it becomes a more viable and robust way to really own the hardware you're supposed
  to own. This talk is meant as a catalyzer for people to go forth with the process
  and finally bootstrap a reasonably more secure computer for themselves, all while
  spreading FLOSS

Since installing Coreboot itself is partly a ritual in itself, and (most of the time) requires physical access to the target machine, it wouldn't be viable to do it as part of the talk. Our goal is to update the community on the most modern ways there are to flash their BIOS and  the exciting new additions to the roster of supported hardware for Coreboot, all in a neatly packed flash presentation.
