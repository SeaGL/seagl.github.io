As we continue on our journey of ensuring the sustainability of free and open source software, we talk about so many things. Funding. Health Metrics. Criticality. Foundations. Corporations. Sponsorship. "Doing The Right Thing."

Today, I want to talk about You, Me, and Us. Because this is what Sustainability is really all about. Humans. Because how we show up for each other matters, and it is the key to sustainably developed free and open source software.

I will cast my observations about the free and open source funding ecosystem against this backdrop as I look at current trends and speculate about our future.
