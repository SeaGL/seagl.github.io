Did you know you can run MySQL on a Raspberry Pi and replicate the data to the cloud?

In this session, we will cover how to install MySQL on a Raspberry Pi, give a brief overview of how to store data on this MySQL instance, demonstrate an application that can visualize that data, and finally, how you can replicate that data to a MySQL instance running in the cloud.
