Mosh is a secure ssh-like mobile shell that works over UDP and is resilient to roaming and machine sleep, works on many restricted Wifi networks, and works on horrible connections. Coupled with tmux you can keep that shell running for days or weeks even as you crisscross the country. Don't leave home without it.
