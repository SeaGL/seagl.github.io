  biography: |-
    Jeff Silverman was born in Portland Oregon which was a good thing as his mother was there simultaneously. He wanted to be a stand-up comedian but computers pay better. Jeff has a BS in physics and he likes to BS in physics.

    He got his first paying job as a computer programmer in 1975 and retired in 2023. He is currently a grandfather and he is teaching his grandsons calculus, which he estimates will take about 15 years.

    Jeff received a black belt certificate in computer security from Coding Dojo in May, 2022.
abstract: You know the tools you use to troubleshoot LANs, but you probably don't
  know when to use each tool. I will discuss the tools available and how they fit
  into the OSI model.

Most of the time, home LANs just work. But what do you do when something goes wrong? This discussion will cover failure modes, how to troubleshoot them, and sometimes how to fix them. This discussion will include wiring problems, WiFi problems, DNS problems, and connections to the ISP. I will also cover how to prepare for a failure.
