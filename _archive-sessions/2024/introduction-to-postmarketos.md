We have embarked on an ambitious goal of creating a flexible Linux-based distribution that can run many user interfaces on a wide range of quirky hardware such as phones, watches, TVs, laptops. We aim to replace proprietary,privacy invading, and attention seeking operating systems these devices include with free software. This talk will introduce the distro, our innovative tooling,and discuss the future of Linux on mobile devices.
