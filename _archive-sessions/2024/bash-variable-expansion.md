Bash's parameter (variable) expansion has several mechanisms to change values as variables are used.

Some change the value assigned to the variable, some only change the value substituted when the variable is used.

Parameter expansion is an essential tool in shell scripting and one-liners.

This presentation uses examples to demonstrate basic parameter expansion and also 10+ builtin expansions.

Parameter expansions include:

* using a default value if the variable isn't set
* using an alternate value if the variable is set
* several ways of changing a substring
* counting the length of the value
* pattern substitution
* capitalizing or lowercasing strings
