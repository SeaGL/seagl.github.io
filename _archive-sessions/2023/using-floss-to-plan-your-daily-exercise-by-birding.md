It's me again with another birding talk! This year, I'm looking to talk about a tool I've made using FLOSS to email me a daily list of parks in my immediate neighborhood that haven't been birded recently. Why? Because I like contributing to community science databases while also walking. This tool is publicly available and used by some other people now - I'll talk about how I set it up, why it's cool, and hopefully - how you can sign up to use it, too.
