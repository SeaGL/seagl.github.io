Everyone loves the idea of diversity and most of us want to think of ourselves as "a good ally.” Not only is it the right thing to do, there are some very appealing benefits that come with making your tech event, project or workplace a welcoming place for vulnerable, marginalized or under-indexed people. More perspectives leads to more innovation and diverse companies tend to enjoy higher employee loyalty and customer satisfaction rates. There are many great talks and papers about how to increase diversity, but they often skip over the difficult parts. We're not doing ourselves any favors by leaving the challenges, costs or even the backlash out of the discussion.

Once we're willing to talk about it, maybe we can come up with some ideas to help each other overcome the stress points? I want to start that conversation. This talk is coming from someone who passionately supports diversity and wants to help others do this work and to set them up for success with realistic expectations.
