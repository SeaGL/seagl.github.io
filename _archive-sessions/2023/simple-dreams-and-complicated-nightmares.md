Free/libre open source software is everywhere -- but that success has come at a cost, and our freedom to follow our own passions is both a blessing and a curse.

In this talk, I'll share results from a series of recent research projects to understand the risks we face and the ways we can protect the health of our movement. I'll share specific actions you and your projects can take to keep building a thriving ecosystem for both contributors and end users.
