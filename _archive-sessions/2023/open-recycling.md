There are many parallels between the principles of Free/Libre/Openness and Sustainability but how do they relate in general? Can they exist without each other, or are they just two sides of the same coin?

This talk is about reconciling ideas across these two complicated paradigms and some more simple / practical examples in which they can align very directly. It was born out of trying to repurpose and reuse materials and industrial parts on the supply side: while considering ways to incentivize the implementation of both Sustainability and FLO(SS) which, at the least, are interdependently entwined.
