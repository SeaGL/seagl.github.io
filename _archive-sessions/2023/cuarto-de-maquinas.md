  biography: I'm a Russian Ukrainian living in Mexico since a young age. My passion
    for computers started a long time ago and has only grown stronger since. When
    I first discovered Free Software and its practical implications, my mind was blown
    and I have never stopped trying to install Linux on everything I get my hands
    on. I use Arch, btw. My formal background is in history, politics and literature.
    I have a BA and an MA in International Relations and used to be involved in the
    local literary scene as an editor. Nowadays I'm part sysadmin and part team manager
    working for a certain company involved with social media management. Always happy
    to find people to talk to and to create with.

Despite Mexico's size, its hacking scene is relatively small, particularly when compared to its counterparts in Europe and the United States. With only a handful of established spaces and a community that lacks a consolidated digital presence, it's clear there's room for growth. The COVID-19 pandemic further impacted this community, leading to the temporary closure of prominent spaces like Rancho Electrónico and HackerGarage.

Five years ago, we attempted to open Kernel Panic Room as part of an independent cultural center. While it was a hack(er)space in name, it lacked the core principles and clear vision that define a true hack(er)space. Now, we're embarking on a new journey with Cuarto de Máquinas (CdM), and we're excited to share our experiences, lessons learned, and future plans with you.

In this talk, we'll delve into the history of our own hack(er)space, highlighting the memes that have shaped our journey and discussing the current state of the hacking scene in Mexico. We'll also give you a virtual tour of our space, share our ongoing projects, and outline our plans for the future. Our hope is that our story will inspire you to embark on your own hacking journey, and perhaps find areas where our paths might intersect. Join us as we chart the course for the future of hacking in Mexico's Bajío region.
