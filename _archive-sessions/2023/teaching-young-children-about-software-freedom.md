Most tech-for-kids stuff emphasizes basic computer use and learning programming. Instruction rarely brings up ethical and social issues with technology. In considering how to best introduce computers to my young son, I developed a plan to help him experience software freedom in practice.

We started with command-line and then moved into bash scripting. My aspiration is see kids sharing scripts with each other and modifying one anothers' programs. That helps them understand free/libre/open collaboration and then be able to start dabbling with the source code of more advanced programs.

Along the way, we have been reviewing which free software games and programs are most accessible. Now, we have a guide that we invite others to check out and help develop: <https://codeberg.org/FLO-Conscience/FLO-kids>

In this talk, we'll share the stories of what we've learned and discuss the importance of framing kids' computing with understanding of the political and social issues in technology.

Note that the first iteration of this talk was given at LibrePlanet 2023: <https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/kids-need-to-experience-software-freedom-not-just-the-idea-of-it/>
