Ever been curious how SeaGL has produced a conference for 10+ years - first in-person, then virtual and hybrid? It takes a lot of hard work, but also a lot of tech!

This talk will give a whirlwind introduction to the free software projects we use to run SeaGL. We'll talk about how the Tech team works with - and benefits greatly from - the broader free software community and maybe even meet some of the humans behind your favorite grassroots conference!
