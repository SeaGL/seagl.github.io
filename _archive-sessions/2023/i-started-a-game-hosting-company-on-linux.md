    By day, I translate developer desires into secure and scalable infrastructure. By night I forego sleep in favor of running [Capitol Hosting Solutions](https://chs.gg) where I strive to offer cost effective and bulletproof hosting services for clients all over the world.

This talk recounts the unique journey of starting a game hosting company using Linux and open source software. We challenged the popular perception that doing anything "fun" on Linux is an impossibility, and have tried to transform this narrative by sharing our tangible results and experiences. With in-depth explorations into our architecture and systems and the challenges we've faced thus far (People, Hardware, and Logistical!) The talk highlights how leveraging the capabilities of open source can create a successful, scalable, and cost-efficient game hosting environment. The "research" (many many nights spent in the datacenter, or on calls with the rest of the team) emphasizes the importance of fostering a diverse gaming ecosystem and advocating for Linux as a viable platform for gamers and professionals alike.
