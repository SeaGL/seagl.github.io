To a modern audience, "Linux" and "Unix" mean pretty much the same thing. User-oriented Linux distributions provide a graphical interface with desktop applications. But Unix wasn't always like that. In this engaging virtual presentation, you'll learn about the origins of Unix, and we'll do a live demo of using Linux like it was Unix from 50 years ago. Bring your own Linux laptop and follow along! We'll use ed(1) to edit files and use nroff to write documents - and do all of it from a terminal! If you're curious about Linux and Unix history, you'll love this session.
