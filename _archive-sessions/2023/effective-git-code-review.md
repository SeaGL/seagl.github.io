Code is better when its gone through more eyes. There's a sweet spot between "showing all your (awful) work" and collapsing everything into a single huge unmanageable commit. We'll discuss how to make it easy to see the evolution while hiding your head ends and mistakes. We'll cover theory and style, nitty-gritty command-line options like rebasing and history editing, as well as review-side with open source gitlab core.
