In 2020 there was an abrupt end to all spin classes. Demand for fancy exercise bikes spikes, along with cost and wait times. Settling for an exercise bike without speed and resistance feedback is simply not an option. What can be done?

This is a perfect opportunity for the Frugal Engineer! Walk through the journey to add visual feedback to an otherwise 'dumb' exercise bike. Combine your Linux computer, a tilt sensor, a speed sensor, and a simple display and save yourself thousands.

This is an overview of what was done, but also lessons learned. Things that worked. Things that didn't. And suggestions for the next Engineer who might embark on a similar journey.
