Your open-source infrastructure's security has never been more important in the ever-evolving DevOps landscape, where speed and agility are supreme.
The topic of this talk focuses on exploring the most important security considerations and best practices for protecting your open-source DevOps infrastructure.
This talk will delve into the core parts of open-source infrastructure security, providing participants with insights and noteworthy methodologies to protect their infrastructure. We will talk about the current threat landscape, focusing on the difficulties open-source infrastructure faces and the potential risks they pose.

To achieve our objective of strengthened DevOps practices, we will explore a comprehensive set of security measures.  From secure configuration management to vulnerability assessment, we will guide participants through demonstrated methods for safeguarding their infrastructure. Also addressing the importance of continuous monitoring and logging, featuring the role they play in recognizing and mitigating potential security breaches.

Understanding the importance of collaboration and automation in the DevOps scene, we will accentuate the integration of security practices through the improvement of the development lifecycle. Attendees will acquire reasonable information on integrating security into CI/CD pipelines, utilizing infrastructure-as-code and automated security testing to guarantee defense against vulnerabilities.
In the technological landscape, this topic is highly significant. In order to safeguard sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain the trust of their stakeholders, organizations must uphold security in light of the growing reliance on open-source infrastructure.

Join us in this exciting session to learn more about securing open-source infrastructure in the fast-paced DevOps world and practical strategies.
