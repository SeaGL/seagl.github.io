Fuzzing is a popular automated bug finding technique.
Frequently Vulnerability Researchers' weapon of choice, it can be
confusing and frustrating for developers to understand fuzzing output
and adapt fuzzing as a tool for their needs. In this talk, we’ll
discuss what fuzzing is (and what it isn’t), its strengths and
weaknesses, how to distinguish different fuzzers, who’s using fuzzers
for what purposes, what fuzzers suit the needs of each group, how to
pick the fuzzer for your needs, and how fuzzing might fit into a
devops pipeline. There will be an optional fuzzing lab based on
docker. Those interested in the lab should have a GCP account ready
for about ~30 minutes.
