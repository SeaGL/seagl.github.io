WebAssembly is a cutting-edge technology that promises to revolutionize computing as we know it. Initially designed for web development, it has quickly expanded to other computing contexts and offers many advantages over traditional programming languages and platforms. In this talk, we will explore the many potential use cases and advantages of WebAssembly across different platforms and industries.

From desktop and mobile applications to gaming and multimedia, scientific computing and data analysis, edge and cloud computing, embedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain and decentralized applications, and artificial intelligence and machine learning, WebAssembly has the potential to disrupt and innovate a wide range of industries and use cases.

We will discuss how WebAssembly is poised to transform not just the web, but also the broader computing landscape, and contribute to a more efficient and streamlined computing experience overall. Join us as we delve into the future of WebAssembly and its potential to revolutionize computing across platforms and industries.
