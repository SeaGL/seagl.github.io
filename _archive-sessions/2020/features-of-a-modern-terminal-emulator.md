  biography: I've been a fan and user of GNU/Linux since the mid 90s. In my professional
    career I've been a programmer, systems administrator, and DBA. I really enjoy
    finding bugs and solving performance problems using a variety of debugging tools
    and techniques. I also enjoy programming in C, Python, Go, Perl, and Elisp.

Depending on your computing platform, there are a dizzying array of terminal emulators from which to choose. Which one will suit you best depends on which features and capabilities you require. Terminals and terminal emulators have come a long way since the teletype, the VT100, and even the relatively modern xterm. In this talk we'll explore the landscape of capabilities and features offered by the modern terminal emulator including:

- Font handling: unicode, icon fonts, fallbacks & more
- SGR escape sequences for italics, bold, underline, strike-through, etc
- Xterm mouse support
- System clipboard integration via OSC-52
- Paste bracketing
- 24-bit color
- Bit-mapped graphics support

Whether you're looking for new ideas to improve your terminal workflow, or to simply freshen up your 80x24 look -- if you spend more than few minutes a day in the terminal this talk is for you!
