You can’t release on time if you don’t know what “on time” means. This talk covers several ways to build release schedules for projects — calendar-based, feature-based, and “meh, it’s done I guess”. Attendees will learn what considerations should go into planning a release schedule, how to deal with exceptions. It will also cover some tools that can be used to give the schedule a physical representation.
