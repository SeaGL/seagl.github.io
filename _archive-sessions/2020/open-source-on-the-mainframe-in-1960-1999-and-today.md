In what could be called a grandfather of open source user groups, SHARE, the first enterprise IT user group, was formed in 1955. By 1960 they had collaboratively adopted and released the SHARE Operating System. This laid the groundwork for what was to become a tight relationship between the mainframe and users who collaboratively got together to develop and share software.

In this talk weâ€™ll explore this history, and where the mainframe is today with relation to the modern open source movement by talking about the latest developments in the realm of Linux for the mainframe and projects maintained by the Open Mainframe Project.
