I'd love to give a talk about using the technology around us and our personal interests to make a social impact, and the ways that open doors to make broader change in unexpected ways. Using Intelligame as an example, I'd like to talk about starting a criticism website using Wordpress and beginning my career as a streamer, but also talk about the social contracts and policies I put together to build the community into a conscious, progressive collective that's raised over $20,000 for charities. Learning streaming also opened a space for me to work with organizations like the ACLU to help them organize online events, which powers even more activism. I think anyone can use the skills they have and the interests they enjoy to help make a difference so long as they connect with the right people and keep an open mind.
