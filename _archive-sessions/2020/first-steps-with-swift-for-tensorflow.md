  biography: Dr Paris Buttfield-Addison is co-founder of Secret Lab. Secret Lab builds
    games and game development tools, including creating the award-winning ABC Play
    School iPad games, the Qantas airlines 'Joey Playbox', supporting the BAFTA- and
    IGF-winning Night in the Woods, and creating and building the popular open source
    YarnSpinner narrative game framework. Paris formerly worked as mobile product
    manager for Meebo (acquired by Google), as the Program Manager for GovHack (the
    longest running and largest government-supported open-data hackathon in the Southern
    Hemisphere), and as a University lecturer. He has a degree in medieval history,
    a PhD in Computer Science, and has written more than 30 technical books on mobile
    development, artificial intelligence, and game development for O’Reilly Media.
    He lives with his more intelligent wife—a researcher using machine learning to
    locate space debris—in beautiful Hobart, Australia.

This session will introduce Swift, the popular free and open source programming language introduced by Apple and developed by a huge community. You’ll learn why Swift is such an in-demand skill, why Swift is such an interesting language, and how to get started with it.

More specifically, you’ll learn how you can use Google’s Swift for TensorFlow project for modern, powerful machine learning on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Swift is a fabulous, powerful, fast, easy to learn alternative and companion to Python (and even works with the ubiquitous Jupyter notebooks). The time has never been better to learn about Swift (for machine learning).

Find out why Swift might just be the future of scientific computing and machine learning in this beginner friendly session.
