Build free CI/CD for your open source repository!

Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) is a popular DevOps method of ensuring software quality and velocity in a modern development environment through automated builds, tests, and deployments.

GitHub Actions is GitHub's built-in workflow framework for tasks such as CI/CD and more. It is fully integrated with GitHub repositories and, best of all, it is completely free for open source!

This hands-on demonstration will go from zero to fully functional CI/CD pipeline in under 20 minutes using GitHub Actions. Attendees will come away with the skills and knowledge (and sample code) necessary to configure automated PR builds, test runs, and continuous deployment for own projects.

This talk is an introductory talk to GitHub's CI/CD offering and is suitable for all experience levels. Content will include introductions of concepts, a "live" coding demonstration of building a GitHub Actions, and time for questions and answers.
