One common problem that all organizations need to solve when planning out their infrastructure is the need for storing secrets, such as passwords, credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data.  Often this information is used for application deployments or simply running company applications.  But it might need to be segmented by environment or use, with only certain groups or individuals having access.  Fortunately there are many free & open source solutions to secrets management.
In this talk:
- We'll look at the various free & open source solutions that are available.
- We'll look at some pluses and minuses for each of them.
- Finally we'll look at using some of these solutions in a real world scenario.
