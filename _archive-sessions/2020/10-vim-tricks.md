Some times you need to write software to solve problems and automate systems. But sometimes all you really need is a good editor and a few tricks up your sleeves.

I find myself frequently turning to vim to handle repetitive tasks, and create commands I'll run from the command line. Why write python when some efficient macros will do, or an occasional `:%s` will save you time?

And naturally we will cover that godsend of typos, xp.

Bring your ideas or needs - we will be both interactive and have show and tell.
