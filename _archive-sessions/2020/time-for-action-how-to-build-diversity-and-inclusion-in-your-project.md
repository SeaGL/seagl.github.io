Diversity and inclusion (D&I) is not a new topic in Open Source. But what does D&I work look like in the context of open source communities? [Bhagyashree “Bee” Padalkar](https://bee2502.github.io/) and [Justin W. Flory](https://jwf.io/) share lessons learned from five years of volunteering and leading D&I teams in open source communities.

In this talk, Bee and Justin tell the story of how the Fedora Project’s [Diversity & Inclusion Team](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/diversity-inclusion/) came to be, what common pitfalls and challenges are in D&I work, and a guiding principle behind everything the team does.
