Do you have a pile of sticky notes, a folder full of spreadsheets, or a dusty
box of business cards gathered at conferences? Have you ever had a donor
approached by multiple people trying to gather the same information? Beyond an
organizational context; are there friends that you haven't spoke to for some
time and would like to, but how long has it been?

We meet new folks daily, whether in a personal context or organizational. Often,
it becomes hard to keep track of where, when, and how the connections were made.
Further, the upkeep of these connections include remembering important dates,
following steps in a particular order, and capturing information from multiple
sources. A solution to assist with all of this is the often used sales tool, a
contact relationship manager (CRM). These provide many features beyond that of a
mere address book.

Come learn about two non-sales focused tools, CiviCRM and Monica. See how they
can be used to clean up your contacts; getting them back under *your* control.
