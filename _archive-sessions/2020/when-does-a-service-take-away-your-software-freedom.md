A lesser known tenet of the free software movement: "You can have
control over a program someone else wrote (if it's free), but you can
never have control over a service someone else runs, so never use a
service where in principle a program would do." -
[gnu.org/philosophy](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html)

But when exactly would a program do? I will dig into the details and
examine popular services so that you can gain confidence in evaluating
services you encounter.

Finally, I will dip into other dimensions of judging services, such as
how they treat your data.
