  biography: Lisha Sterling is the executive director of Geeks Without Bounds and
    president of Frontline Wellness United. A life long proponent of software freedom,
    she spent the first 15+ years of her career working for companies like Wells Fargo
    Bank, Amazon.com and a string of startups you barely remember. Her ideas about
    the importance of Libre software and hardware have been refined in the fires of
    civic and humanitarian projects that affect marginalized people on the outside
    of the digital divide. She has worked on software projects to improve public water
    service in Tanzania, environmental tracking in Guatemala, protection of indigenous
    lands in Ecuador and the US, and the protection of refugees in Jordan and Mexico.
    Over the last three years, much of her work has revolved around keeping vulnerable
    people (and their digital doppelgangers) safe while facing harassment from individuals,
    hate groups, and governments.

If all the networks are owned by a small handful of corporations, how can your network be free (as in speech)? If all the networks are surveilled by the government, how can any network by free? Is there any alternative?

This talk will tell you how to build several types of alternative networks with open source tools that can be used temporarily or for the long term, depending on need and context. I'll talk about choices of hardware and network type, how (and whether) to connect it to the wider Internet, and some basic security considerations to help you plan. I'll broadly cover light-based networks, smartphone network hacks, point to point radio networks, and mesh networks you can build with off the shelf (or thrift store) wifi routers. For each network type, I'll give some pros and cons, along with links to more detailed tutorials so you can try them out yourself.
