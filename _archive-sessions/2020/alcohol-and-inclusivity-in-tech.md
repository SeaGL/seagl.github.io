Alcohol is a major theme in tech culture, whether it's bonding with peers near the office keg, letting off steam with afterword drinks, or meeting industry giants over conference beers. Unfortunately, tech culture around alcohol often excludes people on the basis of gender, medication, religion, pregnancy, addiction, age, and more. We'll learn some of the basic pitfalls to avoid, and then talk solutions with easy-to-practice ally skills for how to discuss, serve, and approach alcohol at events and in the workplace.

We're all virtual right now, which provides a lot more space to make our own decisions free of professional obligation. It's also a great time to reconsider how we approach things, so we can return to the office and events with fresh eyes and new skills.
