# Attend with your Matrix account 

SeaGL uses [Matrix] to run our virtual conference. The whole conference is in a Matrix space and is primarily designed with [Element]'s interface in mind. You can of course use your own preferred Matrix client - just bear in mind we won't be able to help you out as much. Here's the button to get into the space:

<div class="text-center">
  <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-large" href="https://matrix.to/#/#PuFN-2022:kvalhe.im">Join the SeaGL space</a></p>
</div>

TODO make this button point at the production space

Below are some tips on navigating the conference in Element. If you run into any trouble, you can always email <matrix-help@seagl.org>. Remember, participation in any room in the SeaGL space is subject to our [Code of Conduct](/code_of_conduct).

## Navigating spaces

Spaces in Element can be confusing if you're not used to them. There's a page that will show you all rooms in the SeaGL space which will give you an overview of the conference layout and allow you to jump directly to any room:

Getting here is simple but can be difficult to find on your own. First make sure the spaces list on the far left is expanded (you may have to hover your mouse over the left side to see the arrow):

<img class="align-center" alt="Screenshot of the top-left of the Element client pointing out the arrow directly to the right of the profile picture in the upper-left corner" src="/img/element-sidebar-arrow.webp" />

Then hover over the SeaGL space and click the three dots menu:

<img class="align-center" alt="Screenshot of the SeaGL space item in the Element left pane, with the three dots button at the right of the list item highlighted" src="/img/element-three-dots-menu.webp" />

You can also click the arrow on the left side of the SeaGL space to see the subspaces, which can help with navigation.

## Widget prompts

SeaGL makes heavy use of Matrix widgets to provide the conference experience. In particular, widgets are the way we embed YouTube streams into Matrix rooms so you can watch the talks. Because of this, you'll see quite a few permission prompts like this:

You'll need to allow these widgets in order for the conference to work properly.

## Call buttons

The audio and video call buttons in Element aren't used in the Matrix rooms that are streaming talks from YouTube - don't click them. If you lose the YouTube stream by accident, here's how to get it back:

TODO confirm that this is ok for social rooms

## Advanced usage: use our Element client

One option that will solve the above caveats is to use our customized version of Element, available at https://attend.seagl.org/. The reason we don't recommend this in the first place is because submitting your Matrix credentials into random websites is bad practice, and we don't want to encourage it. We're mentioning this option mostly for completeness.

If you insist on using our version of Element - hopefully because you really _do_ have reason to trust the SeaGL staff with your Matrix credentials - TODO instructions for clicking into the attend portal.
