# Attending SeaGL

SeaGL's virtual conference space exists in [Matrix], an open, decentralized chat network. We've set things up so that using Matrix should be easy—just follow these 3 steps. If you _do_ run into any trouble, email <matrix-help@seagl.org> and we'll help you get it sorted out ASAP. <!-- TODO - possibly link to Kiwi IRC too. -->

## Step 1 - get your 2022 attendee account

The first step is to get an account! This won't require any of your personal information and the account will be deleted once the conference has finished. However, for the duration of the conference this account will let you do everything a regular, permanent Matrix account would.

</div>

Come back to this page after you're signed up.


## Step 2 - get oriented

Here is the home screen of SeaGL's [Element](https://element.io/), an open source, free software Matrix client. Our version has been modified to give you a better conference experience.

Some things to know about Matrix and your ephemeral account:

1. Matrix accounts are decentralized, which means that your account is “at” the provider of your choice, but you can communicate seamlessly across providers—similarly to email.
2. We're acting as the Matrix provider for the account you just made—for the duration of the conference. As your account is primarily intended for you to attend SeaGL, it will be deleted on **November 12th** (one week after the end of the conference).
3. While your account exists, it will function as a full Matrix account. Consider joining the Matrix room of a free software project you hear about at the conference! <!-- TODO it would be rad if we could actually see how many talks are about projects with Matrix rooms -->
4. If you decide you like Matrix, we encourage you to get a permanent account and hang out in the [SeaGL space](https://matrix.to/#/#SeaGL:seagl.org) year-round! There are lots of [homeserver options](https://joinmatrix.org/servers/) for using Matrix, but we often recommend going with [Matrix*.org*](https://matrix.org/faq/#who-and-how) as a service provider—a public service operated by the foundation's non-profit.
5. There are [many clients](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now) that you can use to access Matrix, but we often recommend going with [Element](https://app.element.io/) since it's open source and available on many platforms, including the web.


## Step 3 - have fun at SeaGL!

We hope you enjoy hanging out with the flock this year. Our friendly Matrix bot, Patch, will help guide you around the conference. If you have any questions, please bring them up in the ["Welcome"](https://matrix.to/#/#welcome:2022.seagl.org) or ["Info Booth"](https://matrix.to/#/#info-booth:2022.seagl.org) rooms.

As a reminder, participation in any SeaGL space is subject to our [Code of Conduct](/code_of_conduct).
