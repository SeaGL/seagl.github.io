## Volunteer for SeaGL

2023 marks our 11th year as an all-volunteer staffed FLOSS conference.
With three virtual events under our belt, the plan is to begin our second decade with a return to an in-person experience in Seattle.
However, to maintain the remote participants who have joined us, we will be pushing for a hybrid setting.

Would you like to lend a beak or wing to the effort?
Please email us at {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }} or hop into our [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#SeaGL:seagl.org "Link directly to SeaGL Matrix channel") and say hi!
You can also fill out our [Volunteer Interest Form](/volunteer) to let us know how you'd like to help out.


## Staff Committees

The volunteer work needed to put SeaGL together is roughly organized into the following committees. Specific skill gaps will be added as they are identified.

- **Attendee Experience**: Focusing on attendee matters and prioritizing the SeaGL community.
- **CoC (Code of Conduct)**: Making sure the policies and protocols in place keep SeaGL a safe space.
- **Finance**: Keeping an eye on the SeaGL books and issuing reimbursements.
- **IDEA**: Promoting inclusion, diversity, equity, and access at SeaGL and beyond.
- **Partnerships**: Connecting SeaGL with other groups, organizations, and sponsors.
- **Programming & Flow**: Packing the SeaGL program with amazing content.
- **Promotion & Outreach**: Spreading the word about SeaGL world wide.
- **SRE/Technical**: Central nest for SeaGL technical operations.
- **Volunteers**: Keeping the SeaGL staff happy and recruiting new volunteers to the flock.
