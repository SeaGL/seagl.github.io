## Volunteer for SeaGL

SeaGL organization for 2021 has kicked off!
Would you like to help with a great virtual only (per pandemic) conference based out of the US Pacific Northwest?
Our 8th conference last year was also our first virtual conference and we had volunteers from 4 continents.
This year we are returning to a fully virtual model and need volunteers to make it happen.
If you'd like to help please email us at {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }} and we'll send you an invitation to join our organizing meetings every other Monday at 17:00 Pacific Time (UTC-7).

## Sponsors and Non-Profit Exhibitors

Once again, we will have a virtual exhibitor hall for both community and corporate sponsors of SeaGL 2021.
Groups and companies interested in attending should take a look at our [Exhibitor/Sponsor Prospectus]({{ site.custom.url.prospectus }}) which outlines various tiers and add-ons available.
We do accept in-kind contributions from local and media partners, and free space is available for non-profit and educational organizations.
Please see our [sponsors page](/sponsors/{{ site.custom.year }}) for a list of current supporters and email us at {{ site.custom.a.email.sponsor }} to discuss further partnership opportunities!
