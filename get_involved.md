## Volunteer for SeaGL

2025 marks our 13th year as an all-volunteer staffed FLOSS conference.
With three virtual events and a hybrid one under our belt, the plan is to continue improving on an in-person experience in Seattle and online.

Would you like to lend a beak or wing to the effort?
Please email us at {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }} or hop into our [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#SeaGL:seagl.org "Link directly to SeaGL Matrix channel") and say hi!
You can also fill out our [Volunteer Interest Form](/volunteer) to let us know how you'd like to help out.

## Staff Committees

The volunteer work needed to put SeaGL together is roughly organized into the following committees. Specific skill gaps will be added as they are identified.

- **Attendee Experience**: Focusing on and prioritizing the SeaGL community.
- **A/V & DevOps**: Central nest for SeaGL technical operations.
- **Finance**: Keeping an eye on the SeaGL books and issuing reimbursements.
- **IDEA**: Promoting inclusion, diversity, equity, and access at SeaGL and beyond.
- **Partnerships**: Connecting SeaGL with other groups, organizations, and sponsors.
- **Policy & Protocol**: Making sure there are rules place keep SeaGL a safer space.
