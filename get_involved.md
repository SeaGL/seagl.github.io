## Volunteer for SeaGL

2025 marks our 13th year as an all-volunteer staffed FLOSS conference.
With three virtual events and a hybrid one under our belt, the plan is to continue improving on an in-person experience in Seattle and online.

Would you like to lend a beak or wing to the effort?
Please email us at {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }} or hop into our [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#SeaGL:seagl.org "Link directly to SeaGL Matrix channel") and say hi!
You can also fill out our [Volunteer Interest Form](/volunteer) to let us know how you'd like to help out.

### Staff Committees

The volunteer work needed to put SeaGL together is roughly organized into the following committees.
Specific skill gaps will be added as they are identified.
You can read more about the roles and process in this [2024 blog post](/news/2024/03/19/call-for-volunteers).

- **Attendee Experience**: Focusing on and prioritizing the SeaGL community.
- **A/V & DevOps**: Central nest for SeaGL technical operations.
- **Finance**: Keeping an eye on the SeaGL books and issuing reimbursements.
- **IDEA**: Promoting inclusion, diversity, equity, and access at SeaGL and beyond.
- **Partnerships**: Connecting SeaGL with other groups, organizations, and sponsors.
- **Policy & Protocol**: Making sure there are rules in place to keep SeaGL a safer space.
- **Programming & Flow**: Packing the SeaGL program with amazing content.
- **Promotion & Outreach**: Spreading the word about SeaGL world wide.
- **Volunteers**: Keeping the SeaGL staff happy and recruiting new volunteers to the flock.

## Sponsors and Non-Profit Exhibitors

We have a limited number of tables available for business and community partners of SeaGL 2025.
{%- if site.custom.url.prospectus %} Groups and companies interested in attending should review our [Partnership & Sponsor Prospectus]({{ site.custom.url.prospectus }}) which outlines various fiscal tiers and add-ons.{% endif %}

In-kind contributions are accepted from media and local partners.
Free space is made available for non-profit and educational organizations.
Please see our [sponsors page](/sponsors/{{ site.custom.year }}) for a list of current supporters and email us at {{ site.custom.a.email.sponsor }} to discuss further partnership opportunities!

## Presenting at SeaGL

Over the years, we have given a stage to hundreds of speakers. If you're interested in joining them, keep an eye out for our call for proposals (CFP) which usually opens in May and runs for approximately a month.

We make a point of welcoming presenters of all experience levels, especially those bringing uncommonly heard perspectives. So if you're a first time speaker or member of an under-represented group in tech, please consider applying!

That said, **we are not looking for sponsored talks**; while our partners are welcome to submit presentations, we do not guarentee they will be accepted.
