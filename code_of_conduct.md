# Code of Conduct

SeaGL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone; regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, nationality, race, or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of conference staff, volunteers, presenters, attendees, and participants in any form.
Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference, without a refund, at the discretion of the conference organizers.

This Code of Conduct applies during the entire conference and in any conference associate space, online or otherwise.
Which includes, but is not limited to: the conference venue, presentation spaces, exhibiton hall, evening gatherings, and IRC channels.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, nationality, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording without permission, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at this conference.
Exhibitors at the sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.
In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.
Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
Conference staff can be emailed via {{ site.custom.a.email.coc }} or identified by their badges.
We will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment or intimidation to feel safe for the duration of the conference.
We value your attendance.

To respect the privacy of those involved and insulate any legal concerns, SeaGL's policy is to not make public statements about individual Code of Conduct cases.
All Code of Conduct decisions are made collectively by the SeaGL CoC committee.
