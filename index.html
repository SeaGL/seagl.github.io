            for <strong>{{ site.custom.dates }}</strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>You do not need to register for SeaGL - just show up! The cost of attendance is free.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>You may attend SeaGL without identifying yourself, and you are encouraged to do so to protect your privacy.</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://osem.seagl.org/">You may optionally register</a>. This gives us attendee counts, which help us raise money for SeaGL conferences. The registration system is Free/Libre/Open Source Software and we promise to protect your data.</strong><p>

            SeaGL is a grassroots technical conference dedicated to spreading
            awareness and knowledge about the GNU/Linux community and
            free/libre/open-source software/hardware. Our goal for SeaGL is to
            produce an event which is as enjoyable and informative for those who
            spend their days maintaining hundreds of servers as it is for a
            student who has only just started exploring technology options.
            SeaGL's first year was 2013.

            The SeaGL web site is built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">
            Jekyll</a> and we use <a href="http://osem.io/">OSEM</a> for event
            management.
