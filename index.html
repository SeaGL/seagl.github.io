    <h1>SeaGL 2013</h1>
    <p class="lead">The 2013 Seattle GNU/Linux Conference is scheduled for October 11th and 12th at <a href="http://seattlecentral.edu/sccc/">Seattle Central Community College</a>.</p>
    <p class="lead">SeaGL is a new grassroots technical conference in <strong>Seattle</strong> dedicated to spreading awareness and knowledge about the GNU/Linux eco system, Free Software, and the Open Source movement.  We have enjoyed down-to-earth conferences like LinuxFest Northwest for many years, and we feel that the Puget Sound region deserves a similar event for the second half of the year.  Our goal for SeaGL is to produce an event which is as enjoyable and informative for those who spend their days maintaining hundreds of servers as it is for a student who has only just started exploring technology options.</p>
    <p><strong>We will be doing our best to keep the cost of attendance as close to free as possible.</strong></p>
