        SeaGL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
        for everyone; regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
        sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
        nationality, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
        conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
        appropriate at the conference venue or during talks. Conference
        participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
        the conference, without a refund, at the discretion of the conference
        organizers.
      </p>

        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
        identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
        appearance, body size, nationality, race, religion, sexual images in
        public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
        photography or recording without permission, sustained disruption of talks 
	or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual 
	attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected 
	to comply immediately.

      <p>
        Exhibitors at the sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are
        also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors
        should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth
        staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
        clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
        or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
        immediately. Conference staff can be emailed via
        {{ site.custom.a.email.coc }} or identified by their badges. We will
        be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide
        escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment or
        intimidation to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value
        your attendance.
