      SeaGL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
      for everyone; regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
      sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
      nationality, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
      conference staff, volunteers, presenters, attendees, and participants
      in any form. Conference participants violating these rules may be
      sanctioned or expelled from the conference, without a refund, at the
      discretion of the conference organizers.

      conference associate space, online or otherwise. Which includes, but is
      not limited to: the conference venue, presentation spaces, exhibiton
      hall, evening gatherings, and IRC channels.

      identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
      appearance, body size, nationality, race, religion, sexual images in
      public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
      photography or recording without permission, sustained disruption of talks 
      or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual 
      attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected

      Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at this conference.
      Exhibitors at the sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are
      also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors
      should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth
      staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
      clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized
      environment.

      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
      or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
      immediately. Conference staff can be emailed via
      {{ site.custom.a.email.coc }} or identified by their badges. We will
      be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide
      escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment or
      intimidation to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value
      your attendance.

      SeaGL's policy is to not make public statements about individual Code of
      Conduct cases. All Code of Conduct decisions are made collectively by the
