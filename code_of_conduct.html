        SeaGL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
        for everyone; regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
        sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
        nationality, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
        conference staff, volunteers, presenters, attendees, and participants
        in any form. Conference participants violating these rules may be
        sanctioned or expelled from the conference, without a refund, at the
        discretion of the conference organizers.

        Exhibitors at the sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are
        also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors
        should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth
        staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
        clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized
        environment.

        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
        or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
        immediately. Conference staff can be emailed via
        {{ site.custom.a.email.coc }} or identified by their badges. We will
        be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide
        escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment or
        intimidation to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value
        your attendance.
