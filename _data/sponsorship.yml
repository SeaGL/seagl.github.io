      DevOps Party Games takes the idea of "online party games" and tilts it on its head by adding DevOps-inspired content to existing games, and then streams it live via Twitch for a worldwide audience to watch, comment, and hopefully be entertained. In addition, the hosts (Matt Stratton, Jeremy Meiss, and Dan Maher) will provide color commentary, much like a modern day Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks (announcers from Dodgeball).
      The goal here is to have fun and not take things too seriously. A live streamed game show that is most definitely a ridiculous idea, but hopefully entertaining.
