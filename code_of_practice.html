    <h1>Program Committee Code of Practice</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          This is what we believe in and how we operate as we go about our business of building the best possible program and schedule for <a href="https://seagl.org">SeaGL</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As members of the SeaGL program committee and proposal reviewers,
          aside from the <a href="https://seagl.org/code_of_conduct.html">SeaGL Code of Conduct</a>,
          we also agree to operate according to these values and statements:
        </p>
        <h2>Values</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We believe in the importance and power of free and open source software.</li>
          <li>We believe in putting the needs of our audience and our community before our needs or those of our employers.</li>
          <li>We believe in boosting the voices of others above our own.</li>
          <li>We believe in mentoring and helping to create the speakers, leaders, and contributors of the future.</li>
          <li>We believe in supporting diversity in thoughts and experiences in the talks and speakers we select for SeaGL.</li>
          <li>We believe in creating and protecting a SeaGL environment that welcomes all people in safety and comfort.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How Do We Operate?</h2>
        <p>
          How are these values reflected in how we operate as program committee members and reviewers?
          There could be many different ways, obviously, but here are some examples of what we will do our best to do:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Promote the CFP to members of the communities we participate in</li>
          <li>Seek out unreached/underrepresented/underserved communities and advocate for them and their talks</li>
          <li>Provide opportunities for new/less-experienced speakers to present talks and keynotes</li>
          <li>As time allows, assist people with their proposals and accepted talks, to improve their quality and better adapt them for our unique event</li>
          <li>Attempt to do all initial reviews without knowing who submitted them, within the constraints of the system</li>
          <li>Only vote on talks we feel qualified to review</li>
          <li>Abstain from voting on talks where we made substantial contributions to the the proposal (but we can advocate during the review call)</li>
          <li>As much as possible, don't allow our personal or professional biases (or those of our employer) to influence our talk reviews</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We are all pleased to have the opportunity to serve the SeaGL community and share this Code of Practice with you.
